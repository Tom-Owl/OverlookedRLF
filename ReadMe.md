The Overlooked Repetitive Lengthening Form in Sentiment Analysis
-----------------------------
## Overview

We call attention to RLF, an expressive-valuable and prevailed but overlooked informal style. We show that RLF sentences can serve as signatures of document sentiment and have potential value for online content analysis.

Our contributions are as follows:
- We introduce \textbf{Lengthening}, a multi-domains dataset featuring RLFs with 850k samples grounding from 4 public datasets for SA tasks.
- We propose a cost-effective approach \textbf{ExpInstruct}, which can improve the performance and explainability of open-sourced LLMs for RLF to the same level of zero-shot GPT-4. 
- We quantify the explainability of PLMs and LLMs for RLF with a unified approach. Human evaluation demonstrates the reliability of this method.
