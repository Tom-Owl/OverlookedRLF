My engine was over heating and I had my car towed to the dealership, before it got there I called the service desk to let them know. The girl took all the information down (this was at 10am) I get a call at 1:30 pm asking why my car was brought in and what needs to be looked at. I was dumbfounded! So it took me calling twice to even reach the guy and finally explain what happened. Well I didn't here anything from the guy all day. Left him a voicemail at 4:30 and didn't get a call back. Well at 5:30 I called again and the girl at the front desk stated that he was already gone for the day (they don't close till 6:30) and she stated he was the only one who could pull up my file. ITS THANKSGIVING WEEK AND I HAVE TO WORK. So now I have to wait for tomorrow morning for them to open up and get this situated. Plus this isn't the first time they messed things up. Last time I had to take my car here they didn't fix my car correctly and it was leaking oil everywhere. I tried not taking it here but sadly the Lakeland and plant city dealership were all booked up.

If you love oysters but your experience is limited to Gulf oysters, then please expand your horizons. I promise you oysters from various parts of the United States are very different in flavor. There were 16 oyster options and I tried five of them, some from Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Alabama. The Cape Hatteras were pretty much your standard sweet, plump oyster while the most unusual were the very small Paines Creek from Brewster, MA. They had a gritty and very brined flavor and made up for their size with powerful flavors. I also found the Mon Louis from Alabama to be really good with a bit of a tangy bite...went well with the house sauce. My ONLY complaint...if you are going to serve oysters of this caliber, then you should have FRESH ground horseradish...not from a gallon jug...sheesh! 

**ALERT** They make their OWN CRACKERS and were awesome...tasted a bit like crispy Naan bread and was soooooo much better than your generic saltine crackers. Follow all of this up with an exceptional Omme Gang Rare Vos Amber Ale...went extremely well with the oysters. This place is quite ""hipster"" and the crowd reflects the Germantown vibe.

I was his only client during my whole appointment and it seems like he schedules everyone one-on-one, which was really nice! You get his undivided attention and he never rushes the process - which I'm sure is another reason why many of his clients speak so highly of him.

This hotel has all the things I care about most- safe, clean and good location. I also enjoy a bar and restaurant on property and it checks those boxes as well. Thankfully the air conditioning worked very well, so we were very comfortable.

On a previous visit, we stayed in a boutique, old French Quarter hotel and I could barely sleep because it was noisy (and haunted). I preferred the hotel this time because I slept sooo much better. When you're sleeping in New Orleans, bring earplugs (duh) but also this hotel was high enough that I didn't even have to worry about noise. It's also very safe- you put in your floor and get an elevator specifically for that floor. Only once did it assign other floors with us. I would highly recommend this hotel for female travelers worried about creepers trying to follow you to your room. 

Additionally, we stumbled in to get a pizza in the hotel very late. Maybe I was drunk, but it was really solid! We also enjoyed the bar. They held our luggage for us too after checkout. 

It's just on the edge of the French Quarter. You can get everywhere quickly- it's a short walk to Jackson square, about a block from the famous carousel bar and near our favorite NOLA restaurant, Mr. B's.  The lobby bar has great happy hour specials, including chargrilled oysters that are delicious.

Well, the browser extension is not up to date, won't work on WIN 10, any 64 bit browser, chrome, explorer. I was able to work around the issue and view the cams in browser. But never could get the cams to trigger on movement, either to send an email alert, record video or snapshot.

I imagine the shortcomings can be dealt with and maybe if I get the time I'll try their customer service.

A2DRJBVFU4BLY5,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"n the beginning chapter of MIRROR OF OUR LIVES, I didn't quite grasp what was happening, or the direction in which the author was taking me as a reader.  Sitting at my desk, Kindle in hand feeling confused, I trudged on.  But, by chapter 2, Njide Meets Tunji, I was hooked!

Being the kind of woman that I am, coming from very strong female stock, I cringed each time she allowed this man to walk all over her.  I found myself wanting to strangle him myself, to wipe away all those smirks of enjoyment from his face, at the pain he had caused her by parading another woman in front of her, in her own bed.  And then there were those times when I found my chest heaving with pride, when she decided to take back her strength, and I smiled or laughed out loud at the humor she sometimes used as her weapon.  Njide laughed away a lot and her strength shone thru in those times.  How she kept it together, when every move he made dictated that shed fall apart, was beyond my grasp of imagination.  She was by far my most favorite character in this book, and since she didn't take a baseball bat to his head, she is a far stronger woman than I will ever be.

Move along to Ms. Nelly and her dedication and commitment to her familymost notably, her brothers.  Her story moved me as well.  Her silent strength in the face of adversity, caused me to admire the way she chose to handle the lemons life had given her.  We could all take a good lesson from Ms. Nelly.

Im not going to give away any more of this book, because it was such an interesting read, I want you all to go and read it for yourselves.  This book contains the voices of four Igbo women, but their voices and their stories are those of millions of women around the world.  No matter where we come from, no matter what side of the ocean we live, we still face some of the same struggles.  Your blonde, blue-eyed next door neighbor could be suffering as Njide didand youd be none the wiser.  The point Im trying to make here is, you don't have to be Nigerian born to have the struggles these women had.  But to survive their trials, you do have to have their strength and determination.

For those of you who would typically pass on this book because there is a beautiful woman of color on the cover, you're doing yourself a great disservice and missing out on a fantastic, well-written read.  I couldn't put it down and you won't be able to eitherwell, that is, until youve reached the very end.

Went here with two friends on a Friday night (more like Saturday morning) and it was a disaster. We were sat pretty fast In a tight booth. The place was really loud for the time we got there. Our waitress was peppy but annoying. My friend and I ordered grilled cheese with fries and my bf ordered fries with gravy and mozzarella on them (disco fries for the New Jersey people).
Now I have been to a lot of diners. I've been to some of the best in the country (or in nj cause they're everywhere in nj). The food took an hour to come out. AN HOUR. Not 45 minutes, an hour. The grilled cheese wasn't even cooked. It was bread with three slices of Kraft looking cheese on it. I ordered mine on rye and it was on white bread when it came out. The fries were just normal but portioned poorly. My bf's fries had such little cheese on them and the gravy was on the side. It also took an additional twenty minutes to get utensils (which were plastic) and honey mustard - which we asked a different waitress to get. 

Out waitress must have come over to our table 5 times within the hour saying sorry about our order.

We didn't even order anything special. 

When we were done our waitress talked smack about the place and said to give her the tip right in her hands and not on the table cause someone may take it??? Ok... 

We didn't tip her anyway cause it was terrible and she really didn't do anything but badger us for an hour and then disappeared for another. 

I'll never go back here again. Was looking for a diner to replace my home diner in nj but this isn't the one. I recommend going to McDonald's over this (surprisingly the mess up less).

CpTcxSU7nZIsHYCcfWdQIg,Yelp,"I went to Neo of Melaka, I had heard really good things so I was excited. When I got there the lights were very dim, I could barely see. From the moment I walked in the door the ambiance felt like it was trying waaaay to hard. The place was nearly empty and we were sat right away. Our waitress came and told us her name. Then another girl came over and told us she would be our waitress. We said the other girl had already introduced herself and she said they all worked together. We asked if she would be our waitress now and she said, ""if you want me to be."" When the other waitress came out with our waters it was clear she was schocked and upset the other girl was talking to us and the second girl informed her she'd take care of us. 

Our original waitress smiled and left. The 2nd girl apologized for her (even though she hadn't done anything and was very polite about obviously having her table stolen). She then told us she was a manager and a member of the family who owned the restaurant and said something that amounted to how hard it is to find good help. At 7:15 the restaurant was still pretty empty. The waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the food, but gave us way more info than we wanted. It was impressive but she basically told us what to order and we agreed just to get her to go away.

The food was not at all as good as I had heard from friends. It was bland and as Malaysian food goes, it was not very impressive. The plating was nice but we both agreed the food was sub-par and pricey. While we were still eating the waitress came over and started going on about desert. We were still in the middle of our meal. She insisted we had to put in the order for the chocolate lava cake ASAP. We weren't really sure we were going to get desert because we were in the middle of our meal. But we were irritated by our waitress so we just said OK. 

The cake was fine, basic chocolate lava cake. After the waitress left our table she went around the corner and yelled at the girl who was our original waitress, then came out and had a conversation in another language with the manager. The whole thing made us really uncomfortable and it clearly made the servers that weren't part of the family equally uncomfortable.

I had just told the incredibly helpful and cheerful lady at the front counter that this was my first time that I heard ""you are going to love whatever you order"" from one of their long time patrons who was waiting for his order.

So they are basically a sandwich place, with soooooooo many varieties that it is difficult to pick one.  So already looking forward to returning....I asked the lady what she recommended and their two most popular are the Ruben and the Cuban.  So I went with the former.

You get to pick from about 15 different types of salads or bag of chips.  I meant to take a picture of the salads because everyone if them looked fantastic.  I went with potato salad, which was PERFECT!  I will say it is a bit on the small size, so don't expect more than about 3 scoops with your fork.

Now for the grand sandwich.  OMG, so good. Everthing from the soft delicious marble rye bread to the crumbly corn beef with perfectly melted Swiss cheese in just the right amount. Highly recommended.

This place is one of my new go-to locations anytime you are driving down I-4 near the Lowry Park Zoo.

They have tables inside, but because they are so busy, you might be prepared to order to-go and visit the nearby Lowry Park if the weather is good.  It is right on the Hillsborough River.

Can't wait to go back (next week!?!?) and explore the menu with something equally yummy.  They even have non-menu items posted by the front counter with everyone of those sounding incredible.

I got wind of this place back in the Spring as I heard the owner on a podcast that I follow. Didn't get the chance until recently to check it out since it was on the other side of town. This place is my kind of restaurant. There are games to play, a really nice hip hop mural, music that I want to hear that you wouldn't normally hear in restaurants (unedited), and you can sign your name on the walls in the back. I do wish the inside was a little bit bigger, but when it warms up you can definitely take advantage of the patio. The staff is extra friendly, they make good food, and the price is right. What more do you need?

Ok, let me get on the food. They have these mini dough buds called munchies for appetizers that are really good. You can also get a cinnamon version of them. There are some specialty pizzas that you can choose from and you can also build your own. Coming in at 12in with about 8 slices, you can definitely get full off just 4. They load you up with toppings and it's just as good the next day for leftovers. Two of their top specialty pizzas include contributions from other restaurants. Chef Oya has the Trap Pizza (Seafood) and Hank's Briskets has the Woodstock. I got the chance to try both and the Woodstock has my heart. When I took my first bite it was like I was eating a mac & cheese and pulled pork sandwich. If I wasn't sharing with my fiance, I probably would have had the entire thing. It was sooo good.

A320ILVEUY9NYR,Amazon_Reviews/Electronics,"This thing rocks. It's solid, beautiful, and looks very expensive. People who come over admire it. It's made so well that you just want to touch it. Every part is made of light, but solid metal, except for a few screw pockets. I will only add a couple of points to the other reviews: The pistol grip tension is adjustable with the included allen wrench near the base of the handle. I like the standard tension, but some may want to change how easily the socket flows. The cushioned grips are a great touch. I use them with my Celestron 20x80 binoculars and I love holding the warm grips instead of the cold metal! Something I didn't know before buying this is that the legs can be unlocked at the top with the quick press of a button, enabling them to come out to the side and even lifted upward as far as you want.

Genesis is a self-proclaimed player who can't help himself; Phyllis appears to hate the black man so she marries outside of her race; Grover, Jr., is a single father who is drug and alcohol addicted and Grace is the baby of the family who struggles with forgiveness while trying to bring her family back together and find peace within.  As you continue to read you will understand the root of their behavior.
From The Hearts of Men we are reintroduced to Prodigy and Nina, which is a treat.  The story centers on Genesis and his impending marriage to Terri.  Terri is everything that Genesis wants and needs in a woman but for some reason he can't stay faithful.  Each sibling has his or her share of drama in addition to Genesis, which gives the story its completeness and leaves you with a better understanding of the crosses they have to bare to get to a semi-happy medium.
Travis Hunter does an excellent job of portraying and developing his characters in a very realistic manner. I found myself caring about these characters and hoping for a resolution to their issues.

Ambience in the place is night but they sat us at a table right next to the swinging doors to the kitchen so the entire night I listened to competing music - what was being played in the dining area and the music they were playing for the cooks in the kitchen... enough to give me a headache. They were also extremely loud and I could hear them cursing and goofing off. I had to lean in to hear anything my friend was saying.

For drinks we both started with the Kolsch which was good but nothing to write home about. La cabra falls prey to the common mistake of having waaayyy to many heavy IPA's and high ABV's. There are plenty of good craft lagers, pilsner's, etc. Please explore some diversity in your beer offerings.

We got the chips and guacamole for a snack. Came with what seemed like a lifetime supply of utterly saltless and flavorless chips and a 4 oz container of bland guac. So disappointing.

I picked the Residence Inn because of the price, reviews, and location. I'd never stayed there before, but have stayed at other Residence Inns and lots of Marriotts, so I felt pretty comfortable going in.
What a surprise when I got there! The hotel is beautiful - really pretty dark wood, reds and orange accent colors, lots of cool plants and accent pieces. It really felt more like I was in a boutique hotel. My room was just as great! Awesome TV, comfy couch & bed, great desk with good light and extra plugs. The entire place is SPOTLESS - room, hallways, elevators, the whole place is soooo clean. And the kitchen was great - I got dinner at Factor's Deli (across the street) and brought my leftovers back with me. 
I had my car, but it was so nice to walk around to get something to eat (Factor's Deli is awesome and turns out they also do the room service for the hotel too). There's a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf around the corner, and a few other places. Ended up back at Factor's for lunch on Saturday (try the Grilled Cheese and Hot Corned Beef on rye!) I also did some sightseeing while I was there and was really close to a lot of things. Great new shopping center in Century City was really nice.
I saw some of the reviews mentioned noisy, but I actually had a street view with 2 huge windows facing Pico and I didn't hear a thing. It was REALLY quiet. Free WiFi in the hotel was a nice bonus too. Connection was good, no drops, and really pretty fast.

This was my first time using a GPS device and it was soooo easy.  You will never get lost with this.  If you take a wrong turn it just automatically recalculates and tells you within like 2 seconds which way to go from your present location to get to your destination.

You can search for shop names to see which are near your current location, which are on your route, or which will be near your destination.  You can also search for categories instead of a particular name you can just choose food for example.  You can save addresses to your favorites, see which police stations, hospitals, gas stations etc are near you, this thing has so many great features and you don't even have to keep looking at the screen because it talks to you.

The only thing I can say negative about this is that the little rubber suction cup kept losing its grip on the windshield after the second day of using this.  However I found that if you just clean the suction cup with a little bit of rubbing alcohol it sticks fine again.

A3MMJEMXBJOJ8H,Amazon_Reviews/Electronics,"One day, after looking through all my photos, I got really paranoid about losing them, my iTunes and everything. After all, hard drives all fail, right? And I have been lucky for a long time, so the laws of averages were clearly catching up with me.

The Time Machine promised automatic back-ups, speedier wireless connection to the internet and even wireless printing. This is all good stuff and so in a short time the UPS guy came and I went about installing it.

If you are going to use it as an internet connection, not just a back-up, get all that UP, IP, PPP nerdy stuff written down somewhere. For some reason, TM substituted some random numbers and I couldn't get it to connect.

Similarly, if you want wireless printing, and you do as it is sooo cool, you have to make sure you have already downloaded and installed the latest driver for your printer. Even so, there is the usual problem with too many places to locate printers, select them and all that. I ended up going through the installation procedure several times and then, click-click, it just worked. I don't know why I had a problem or how I fixed it.

The whole printer preferences thing is so much better than it was years ago, but still needs simplification.

I did my initial back-up wirelessly. It took a few hours, but went smoothly.

Time Machine works perfectly, the interface is easy and subsequent back-up are very quick and behind the scenes. Totally unobtrusive. It looks very nice.

It does run quite warm, even when nothing is happening. This seems like a waste of electricity to me, and perhaps a shorter life than it should have. Set-up could be easier, perhaps even automatic for simple installations. These are the reasons why I took off a star.

Time Machine is, I think, the best choice for most people and I recommend it.

A27MZUXMW8HOOJ,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"I have read many books authored by David Loades and this one is definitely my favourite because it covers absolutely everything about Henry VIII's reign. David Loades nicely combined the King's politics, military developments and private life, creating a very interesting and vibrant portrait of the 16th century England.

The book starts with discussing Henry VIII's family and background, his father's claim to the throne and victory at the battle of Bosworth, Henry's education and interesting details about his early life. The young Henry's character is extensively covered as well so we learn about his love for all kinds of sports, his intellectual pursuits and his passion for the tradition of courtly love. There are several chapters covering the wars during Henry VIII's reign so if you are looking for a political/military biography this most likely will be your cup of tea. If, from the other hand, you would like to learn more about Henry VIII as a person, you will find interesting chapters as well. Loades details Henry's relationship with his subsequent wives and discusses their impact on his character and politics.

David Loades has done a great job at bringing history to life in this detailed portrayal of Henry VIII's life and those that surrounded him during his reign. Mr. Loades provides the reader with a detailed examination of Henry VIII's life and the court organization through which he exercised power. The huge amount of primary and secondary sources is listed at the end of the book, so if you enjoy checking the sources for yourself, this book doesn't disappoint.

APJPO2UTSFQSY,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"I rarely read romances because they're just soooooooo formulaic, but I very much enjoyed this entire series (including this, book #1) because the romance element takes a bit of a back seat. Instead, it focuses on Amy and Effie Tribble, 50-something spinster sisters of high society whohaving been left nearly pennilessdecide to earn their living by taking on ""difficult girls"" to get them married off during the London season. The sisters are highly eccentric and a delightful contradiction of tough, lovable, bold, and sometimes vulgar and vain  and, in an age where most people their age are dead, still themselves dream of romance.

I'm not so much rating this particular book as the entire series  it has great wit, charm and an addictive readability.  Each story features one girl the sisters are trying to fob off on the marriage market. The author did a great job of giving each book its own unique drama andeven betterthe Tribble sisters a fun story arc of their own.

A28WYUSTYJMM1L,Amazon_Reviews/Electronics,"Ok, so this mp4 player has some issues, but for 18.99, IT'S WORTH IT!!!!! (ESPECIALLY WITH 8 GB!!!!). The charging cable doesn't really work, but if you have an iPad or iPhone charger (4s and below for iPhone), this is the best thing for your money. If you don't have one, you can buy one for 1.50 with free shipping by searching Delton Premium Iphone 4s Data Sync Cable - Retail Packaging - White.  The first and second times I used it, the battery drained fast, but at about the third time, it lasted for a long time. Also, it wasn't easy figuring out how to use it since the instructions are very limited, but once you figure out how to completely use it, you could use it in your sleep :) . The FM radio is a really nice addition, and isn't very nice at first, but once you figure it out, it's really nice. Music was easy to load onto it, but videos were a little hard to figure out. To put videos on this, they need to be in .amv format. So how I did it was: 1) Find a video you like on youtube. 2) Go to keepvid.com and put the url of the youtube video into the box. 3) Make sure to click run on the java applet. 4) Save it as an .mp4 . 5) Download an amv converter (it's harder to find one for a mac but I did). 6) Put in the .mp4 of the youtube video into the converter and make sure you put in the destination in a place easy to find. 6) Drag the completely downloaded .amv format video into the mp4 player's folder. 7) Find the video in the video section of the mp4 player when you turn it on and enjoy! :).
The video will look strange in .amv format, but I can live with it. Also, if you get a free version, they will put a watermark on your video.
But basically, this is the best mp4 player I've ever had from amazon (a LOT have just been garbage). The material does feel a little cheap, but it looks really nice :).

yAgf_CkQWpd1qloRA5gOgQ,Yelp,"I don't often leave reviews. So first the pro: Really great beer, the food is also good and different from the boring pub food on most menus in Indy. 

Parking is a real challenge. I don't know what could be done about that though. Even on a normal weeknight, I had to park blocks away. Not a big deal but something to consider. 

The service was lacking. Very slow. Even just to get your name on the list! We walked in and there was nobody there to greet us for a good few mins. A waitress even delivered a drink for someone at a table right beside where I was standing and didn't even say ""Hi. Someone will be right with you."" I don't expect red carpet treatment at all. But it was awkward. Our food took quite awhile to come out later.

I cannot stress enough how LOUD it was. This was just an ordinary Wednesday night, a few weeks ago. The booths seem nice, but the tables are very, very close. Family style seating. Which is ok if you're in a big group but can be a little uncomfortable if you aren't. Be prepared to hear pretty much everything the people at the tables next to you say. Since they can't hear each other either!

The bar area on the other side of the wall is oddly arranged. You walk into a large room and the bar is over in the corner, cramped. With allllll this empty space on the other side of the room for darts. And zero fabric anywhere. I mean nothing whatsoever to soak up the sound. I found myself yelling so hard just talking with the person next to me that I was hoarse later. Again, a weeknight with nothing going on--no game on TV, nothing. 

Definitely not comfy chairs at the bar or dining room. Not a big deal to some people, I'm sure. But it's all just so bare and harsh. I was kind of longing for something comfortable, anything. 

I want so badly to love it because I love the concept so much. Indy really needs places like this that feature and support local brews. I want to support non-chain, neighborhood places like this. They've got the food and drink part right. But so much more is needed in terms of atmosphere and service. It would make so much sense if the beer served was just like something you found on the Broad Ripple strip. I wouldn't care about the atmosphere. But this is a special place serving one of a kind, quality stuff. I guess I wanted it to step up to the plate and cater to people who appreciate that good, local flavor.

A2J5XT2BXDHK29,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"Bluff by Julie Dill was one hell of an original, realistic story. The prose was fast-paced, insightful and the protagonist had me on high alert from page one.

The story is narrated by Chelsea, a seventeen-year-old trying to make ends meet when her father is clueless about her expenses and the overall household responsibilities. I just felt he was trying hard, but there was something missing from his life.

My gut twisted with the fact that her father was not an alcoholic or a drug abuser. I expected him to be the usual going-on-a-bender type. But, no, it was his daughter risking her life just for the sake of keeping up with the bills.

Noooooo, she doesnt turn into a prostitute either.
She uses her brain! Accept my apologies, if you're disappointed!

Chelsea is intelligent and finds a way to make some risky money. She is practical and the complete opposite of her laid back father. She knows her problems won't go away unless she does something about it. She is not expecting anyone to take care of them and finds a way (dangerous way) to make sure her bills are getting paid.

Chelsea is a normal teenager risking her life for something as basic as food. She also does commit silly mistakes that validates her as being a human being and acting her age. She is intelligent and witty.

She doesnt have answers to all her problems, but she sure is persistent to find the solutions. I really like that about her!

Chelsea is not the generic teary-eyed teenager crying over a boy. However, there are still some slips she makes because of her young age that makes her even more appealing. Her motivation is practical and it broke my heart on countless occasions.

Not once does Chelsea blame her father for not keeping up with the expenses (except in the final chapters). Through her, I could see what a normal teenager would hope her life to be and when it is not, how does the society look at her as well. I was on an emotional trip with her.

Honestly, the narrative was so captivating that even if Nate, the probable love interest in Chelseas life didn't make an appearance, I sure as hell wouldve finished reading her story anyway. She is that powerful.

I love it when such strong female characters are written and I thank Julie Dill for developing Chelseas character so well.

Chelsea also strikes an unlikely friendship with Miss Stella and it is beautiful. Both are missing something important in their lives and are filling it up by each others company. Girl Power for sure!

The last page threw me off completely because I didn't see it coming. Damn it! I have so many questions.

Most important of all:
Will there be a sequel?
There has to be..I hope. Dear, God!",1,"Noooooo,","No+,","No,","Noooooo, she doesnt turn into a prostitute either.",She uses her brain!,0,1,"['Noooooo,' 'she' 'doesnt' 'turn' 'into' 'a' 'prostitute' 'either.']",[5 2 3 2 2 1 3 2],0,1,0,1.5,8,4,477

Certainly quaint and a great setup - but the food (breakfast) was horrible. Given that this is a place for Country Ham, biscuits and all the fixins', they ain't up to it. Ham was not up to any other place that serves it, redeye gravy incredibly weak. Biscuits - doods - quit using baking soda with aluminum - like sticking an aluminum plate in your mouth. Plus, they had a terrible sweet afterbite when dipped in Redeye. Jelly and Jams were good, but ain't why you go out to eat. Interesting - asked for eggs over easy and was told that that meant the yolk would be close to hard. Let's try turning down the heat on the stove. In short - if you can't fix eggs right, where do you rise from. If you can't fix Country Ham right - then don't call yourselves Country.

Now, I know there are thousands of country stars plastered on the walls. Cool, but these folks know their mamma and grandma made better. I'd take my picture down.

As hard as it is to get Country Ham, I make it all the time - I beat this place hands down - which means they don't make the cut for a place I'd go out to.

18114818,TripAdvisor,"First, let me say that I am a big Westin Hotel fan. I love their heavenly bed and bath products and have always found the customer service to be wonderful. And, the Westin's I have stayed at when traveling with my dog have been amazing. They welcome him with no fees and it's a pretty hassle free experience (my dog is a 60lb Husky/Sheppard Cross). 
This Westin was pet friendly, and when we arrived they even told us we'd been upgraded. They told us we would be on the starwood preferred guest floor with free apples and water and have some extra space for the dog, and us. Yeah! Good news.
When we arrive to our room, we are thrilled with the view. We overlooked the water and had a nice sized room. But here's where the Westin really let me down:
1) The carpet in the room was disgusting! Maybe this is their special dog room... but it was gross. Wear your shoes to bed kind of gross. The other Westin's never put us in gross floored rooms just because we had a dog - besides we signed a form saying we'd pay for any damages so there is no need to put us in an icky room just because we have a dog.
2) The bathroom floor was dirty...hairy, fuzzy, dirty. The tub had hairs in it too. EW.
3) No robes. No amenities except for shampoo, conditioner and soap. No free water that they had talked up...and after talking up the heavenly dog bed that is provided...we never got one.
4) In general the room was tired and really needs a redo. 
But the bed was as comfortable as ever and the view was wonderful. And, we were soooo exhausted when we got to our room at 10:30pm we just made sure the sheets were clean and went to sleep.
In the morning when we needed extra time they extended our check out no problem. So... I should have complained, but I also shouldn't have needed to. It's a Westin!! I won't be back and I won't recommend it unless I hear it's been renovated.
A few other things you should know:
1) Valet charge is $38
2) Location is FANTASTIC if you want to shop or go to Pike Place Market or just wander downtown Seattle.
3) The concierge desk works darn hard to make you happy. I have to give them two thumbs up for their efforts.

If you are willing to settle for a little less than perfection, you could find another speaker from one of the above mentioned brands for around $99 to $150... maybe $200. The other brands can compete on things like features(equalizers), remotes, portability(batteries), volume, amount of bass, speaker power etc.. But where Bose is best is in the precision of the sound its speaker dock produces. It seems almost similar to wine ... you can find good bottles for around $30 that will satisfy most any avid wine drinker... but to have wine PERFECTION, you are looking at a few hundred bucks. It's up to you what kind of quality you want. I can recommend this dock, but I know most people would be content with less expensive options, as would I.

A33BN2CMNY8X38,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"I actually contacted Barbara directly about a month ago to ask her about the difference of content of the two books and ordered her books and Cds from her and not from Amazon but I read the reviews of Amazon readers before deciding to contact her. Everybody seemed to be very satisfied and fascinated by the books so I decided to try and buy them.

I began to read them as soon as I got them and I couldn't stop reading and watching at myself in a mirror and write all pieces of information down until midnight :-)! I felt different. I could understand myself better.

My partner has always told me that I should change my job and earn more money and I always told him: I like my job, I like working with people and to me it is really fulfilling. He earns more than me but he is always under stress and nervous. When I read that arched eyebrows, a rounded hairline and broad cheeks are typical signs for a person who likes to work with people, I knew why I liked my job. My face just shows I'm doing the right thing.

The next step for me was to look at my children, my partner and my parents to see if the descriptions matched. They really do and it is incredible how many detail one discovers!

Without 'having to', I find myself practicing every day. Sometimes I only see a couple of important features at once but I'm too excited to analyse more!!! I also noticed that I usually look at people's eyes and what they express and when people have left I can't remember the other facial features. I'm learning to look at the whole face and pay attention to other details.

Of course it is great to have a foto of someone. Sometimes I compare the picture of someone I don't know in the newspaper and only after having looked at their facial features, I read the article to find out what their job is and compare it with my findings.

Another interesting subject for me is love and what to look for in a person to understand that it is the right partner.

I've also learnt that what I 'feel' when I'm with somebody is right. The facial features, the way I'm looked at etc. actually confirm my impressions. I've had questions about some facial features in the last days and I was glad to receive Barbara's friendly reply very quickly.

A2LNSXDWM2EF2X,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"All I can say is wow, wow, wow!!! This book blew me away. The story opens with a prologue of a man floating in a pool and paralyzed. We meet Gabriel Blackstone a thief and remote viewer. He is hired to find out what happened to the young man. Gabriel can use his remote viewing skills to see the last few minute of the mans life. What he sees doesnt make sense to him until he meets the sisters.

The Monk sisters are distant relatives to John Dee, a renowned mathematician, astronomer, astrologer and occultist. Morrighan is daring and an activist while Minnaloushe is an expert in memory. Both sisters are beautiful and seductive and soon Gabriel falls under their spell.  The author spins a web that catches the readers and quickly draws them in.

The story is full of alchemy and magic. We travel with Gabriel as he slams a ride a term the author created to describe the experience of remote viewing. When I started this book I did not know it would keep me up until I finished.  There were unexpected twists that keep me wondering what would happen next.

We were given 2 options of seat and chose a table for 8 and then the other 2 would have their own while still being able to sit on the back deck overlooking the beach. After waiting 30 minutes they sit us on the side by the hotel pool at 2 tables for 6 people each. When questioned, they tell us it's all they have so we just left it at that. The waitress came after several minutes and took our drink order and was supposed to come right back to take out food order. We knew what we wanted to eat after having waited for seating. After 10 minutes she finally returned to take out food order and it seemed like they were out of a lot on the menu (May have just been our luck and their ability to restock). Food arrived and was ""alright"" but nothing much to write home about. Prices don't match the amount or quality. Drinks never got refilled and we only saw our waitress one time the whole meal. She wasn't even the one to bring us our meal and it wasn't that she was busy at other tables because where we sat, there wasn't that many people. Check came and they added an 18% gratuity to our check due to the ""large"" party. We spoke to our waitress about it and the manage needed up coming out. We weren't happy at having been sat separately in a different area, and not having seen our waitress but once.  Empty drinks and the manager was rude about it and wouldn't remove the gratuity.

I notice a lot of people in the reviews say that its heavy or it's bigger than what they expected but I have no complaints because it does exactly what I need it to do, be a portable external battery, the size doesn't bother me because I could just throw it in the Cinch bag that came with it, stick it in my backpack and be on my way. it has a nice rubbery finish thats texturized for grip. the only thing I'm not a fan of is the orange.

A3LCK07K01T0TX,Amazon_Reviews/Electronics,"I was originally going to buy a larger car battery jumper like I've seen road side assistance folks use but after seeing these little guys and reading the reviews, I decided to purchase this one in July 2015. I've only used it to charge my cell phone but today after work, I made a quick stop at a store. When I returned to my car and turned the key, it would not start. I pulled out this jumper kit, attached the clamps to the car battery, plugged it into the charger, then turned the car ignition key. The first attempt didn't work but with the 2nd try, my car roared back to life! I am sooooo grateful because it was a hot summer day and I was worn out after a long day at work. I even used it to charge my cell phone earlier today and yet it still had enough power to start my car! Everyone should have one of these in their car! Highly recommended!!!

NEXT DAY UPDATE (7/27/17): My car battery did not hold the charge so I obviously needed to replace it but this awesome Energen Power Jumper again saved the day by powering up my car so I could get to the dealership! I was less than an hour late to work because I was able to jump start my car with this product rather than waiting for assistance. The power jumper still had most of its charge so I only had to plug it in to recharge for a very short time after using it yesterday. Again, this is a FANTASTIC product and have been telling all my co-workers this morning to get one. :)",1,sooooo,so+,so,I am sooooo grateful because it was a hot summer day and I was worn out after a long day at work.,"Again, this is a FANTASTIC product and have been telling all my co-workers this morning to get one.:)",1,1,"['I' 'am' 'sooooo' 'grateful' 'because' 'it' 'was' 'a' 'hot' 'summer'

A3B23HN1O7M7LS,Amazon_Reviews/Electronics,"I wanted a cover that was going to stand up so I could read hands free. Even though the product had instructions, they weren't very clear. I couldn't figure them out at first and put the cover together the wrong way so it didn't stand up at all. I figured that this must not be right so I tried again. Finally, I saw that you had to pull open the strip of velcro on the back and attach it to a small patch of velcro on the front of the cover. The company had portrayed that strip of velcro as some kind of handle or grip to hold the cover when reading, so it never occurred to me that it was involved in standing the cover up.

There was a little tab holding down the strip of velcro. It looked like it was metal but I was disappointed to find out that it was velcro too. It was soooo hard to get that tab off of the strip of velcro that I began to think I wasn't going to be able to. Finally the tab opened and I pulled the strip of velcro around and under the cover to attach it. I did that and the cover was standing. The problem was that the velcro wasn't flush with the bottom of the cover. This made the cover rock from side to side when I tried to set it up on my table.

It made me upset that the cover wasn't stable and that the text was tilted because the Kindle was. When I thought about how hard it was to open up the velcro, I could imagine the tabs that held the strip open or closed would pull off sooner or later. Between those two problems I decided to send the cover back. I had gotten 30% off the price through the Kindle deals, but that still wasn't enough to offset the disadvantages.

52914891,TripAdvisor,"My husband and I stayed at the Grace from 26-30 December 2009. What can i say? What a great little hotel at such a good price! Granted, the rooms are a little small, but what do you expect in New York City - none of the hotel rooms are very big. The rooms themselves though were completely kitted out, lovely double bed, flat screen TV, DVD player and iPod dock as well as safety deposit box and small fridge. If you are like us and you are in NY to see the sights and do a bit of shopping then you don't really spend that much time in the hotel - but when we did, I have to say it was a pleasure! The staff were very helpful and the breakfast included in the tariff was a lovely extra, though you do need to be up either early or late to get a table - it seemed to be busiest between 8-9am (though it is open til midday!).
The location...fantastic! right off Times Square, on W45th Street which itself has some really nice Irish pubs if you fancy a nice drink, they also do some really good food! 
If goood food is what you are after go to Bobby Van's - food is superb, it is pricey at $50 for a steak [that comes with no sides] but boy do you get 50 dollars worth of meat! There must have been half a cow on my husband's plate!

We debated between getting a cinnamon roll or red velvet pancakes as a morning appetizer. You can see from the photo what we picked. It was incredible, you would know that if you have ever had anything from their bakery.  The fresh squeezed OJ had great taste and nice pulp. Both my wife and I went with a Benedict this morning.

The adult beverages look yummy but we weren't starting with the booze this morning. They have you check out at the counter so you have to walk past all the tasty treats.

_AET5k1Wk2aTPFJxnrTPEw,Yelp,"TLDR: Great Dessert! Definitely will be back!

Keep in mind this is a buffet. There will always be hits and misses. For me, if the hits far surpass the misses, then it's a good buffet.  This is a good buffet.  I'm believe they must have revamped it, because I have been here in the past, and it was marginal and forgettable. I was there a week ago, and I still remember many of the dishes that I ate.

They have a made-to-order pasta section, which I really loved. You pick the protein, the sauce, the pasta, and all the fixings that they offer. Cooked fresh, this was really good. They also have a made-to-order pho station as well, but I didn't try it.

My wife loved their prime rib. She's not much of a cow fan, but she had two slices. I think the quality of the meat depends on how busy the buffet is... In other words, if the meat has been resting tooo long on the carving station, of course it's dry. But we went just when the buffet opened up, so the two slices she got were very tender and juicy.

They have a HUGE dessert selection... They had tarts, cakes, ice cream and even DONUTS!!  The donuts were really special, and what in general, lifted this buffet to above average. They were airy and light, and crunchy on the outside. They were so good, we took some home and the next day were still very delicious!

Some of the misses were the Indian food... they didn't taste very authentic. Also a lot of the personal bowls weren't that great either. One of them was labelled Mac and Cheese, but instead it was some kinda chicken beef stew thingy... not what I was expecting at all. Also some dishes were a little too salty as well, which isn't too healthy.

The buffet includes all the free drinks you can want. We even saw a bar there, but as we don't drink, we don't have a clue if that is included in the price. The wait staff was pretty responsive, clearing our plates constantly.

I just came here with my family and the only thing that was good was their tomato basil and mozzarella salad, because honestly, how could you mess that up? We ordered their wings and they were way too salty. We ordered their meatballs and they weren't even hot. We got a meatball pizza which was the second best thing we got. We also ordered the cauliflower pizza and I was extremely excited for it only to be extremely disappointed. It was wayyyyyyy too salty none of us finished our first slice. Our waitress Lilianna was also really avoidant of our table she never once came up to check to see how things were so the only time I was able to tell her we weren't happy was when we were asking for the check. We also tried so many times to flag her down, calling out ""excuse me"" but she didnt give us the time of day. When I told her about the salty pizza she continued to ask if we wanted a box for it... Like OBVIOUSLY not. She gave us the check without taking the pizza off of it and when I asked her if she could take it off she very carelessly said, ""I already talked to the manager about it and she's going to come over."" Okay... Cool but why did you not tell us as you dropped the check off that you were doing anything to take care of it? Then when the manager came over she started telling us that there's Romano cheese on the pizza and that's why people tend to find it too salty and that ""next time if we ever want to try the pizza again"" (seriously?) that we should ask for less Romano. So if other people tend to have the same problem why weren't we warned when we ordered it that it may be too salty so maybe we want to go light on the Romano?

Rechargeables were great however they wouldn't last more than a year or so with the cheap trickle chargers, which was extremely expensive also.  I'm into RC car's so I used one of my expensive fully adjustable chargers to start charging my AA's, well they lasted longer but not always the easiest thing to do.  Finally found this charger, so glad I did. Now I have about 150$ worth of powerex 2700 and imedion's that I use for everything and this charger keeps them going without destroying them.  Within the last year I only had to retire a couple older energizer batteries that were not that good to begin with.  It is so worth knowing that my battery investments will last a long time.

Pro's:
Batteries last longer
Faster Charging

Con's:
None

To make your batteries last the longest:

1) Use the charger in break in mode or refresh/analyze then note the mAH for the battery, use batteries in sets that have very close mAH, this makes sure your device lasts longer.
2) Recharge your batteries with the refresh/analyze  setting at least once a month or maybe two.  This makes sure they don't destroy themselves.  If batteries aren't charged regulary it can reduce their charge life.

I think the only series I have yet to complete is The Random Acts of Crazy set.  But let me tell you,when Uncle Mike started to describe picking up one of the characters, I lost it!! I literally laughed sooo hard that I had to use my inhaler ( I am an asthmatic who is totally controlled with minimum meds!!) This billionaire series is one of the best things I have ever read.

You are laughing hysterically and your 12 year old daughter is telling to be quiet because she can't sleep!!
I have spent a small fortune on all her Kindle books, but they are worth their weight in Gold, for sure. This novel was particularily crazy due to the wedding, etc!!

First off, their edamame is garlic edamame and it is AMAZING. I've never had garlic edamame before and I'm not quite sure why because it is incredibly delicious. Normally, it's $4 on their regular menu and I'd still order it.

My friends and I all ordered a bunch of their happy hour sushi rolls and some appetizers. The sushi rolls we got were: dynamite roll, firecracker roll, sesame tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll, crunchy Florida roll, Mexican roll, and spicy crunchy tuna roll. The rolls were pretty big for $5 (most of them had 8 pieces) and fairly fresh tasting. Probably one of the better sushi places in North Tampa. I particularly enjoyed the spicy crunchy tuna roll and the crunchy Florida roll... would not recommend their dynamite roll or sesame tuna roll. The appetizers we got were the chicken tatsu-age (fried chicken with a spicy/mayo-y sauce) and the dynamite mussels -- both delicious!

For the amount of food and alcohol that we ordered, the bill was not bad at all! Definitely recommend coming for the happy hour. 

One of my other friends ordered some of the specialty sushi rolls off the regular menu and they were all very fresh-tasting. The one in particular that I loved was the surf and turf roll - YUM!!!!

When we confirmed that yes, we are, he said usually vegetarians order it without the bacon on top and that we should just do that and we would ""Survive."" yes, those were his exact words. We asked if he could ask the chef, and he said ""okay, I'll look in the computer. It comes out of a bag and we heat it up."" Ummmmm, in that case never mind. I guess I should have realized because I mean, it's Chili's, but it was one of the only places open. But really, why would you tell your customers that your soup comes out of a bag that you heat up?

Then, when we got our appetizers, there was a hair in our dip. Thank goodness the server was properly horrified at this and took it off our bill.

Loads of space, super comfortable bed, great views out toward Lexington Ave., the decor was beautiful - and did I mention the comfy bed? The decor and style of the hotel was definitely hipper than your standard Hyatt. Loved having the mini fridge, microwave and sink to put a few snacks in. The bathroom was good-sized, although they could do with some fluffier towels - they seemed to be pretty worn out for a hotel that is only a few months old! That was the only complaint for the room though; we loved it, which was good because the days we were there were absolutely freezing and venturing outside for long was not much of an option! 
Another bonus - we were arriving off a cruise and were seriously hoping for an early check-in and our room being ready around 10 am - and it was, which just got the stay off to the right start! It was great to be able to walk in, check in, and go back to sleep! 
the front desk/concierge were very friendly - the only thing I would ask for there is an actual doorman. It was difficult getting loads of luggage in and out, hailing a cab (although the front desk/concierge did go out to the corner one time to find a cab for us), etc. The things you expect from a NY doorman. Not a deal breaker by any means though. Never used the lounge, so can't comment there, although it was nice to know it was available.
The location was great, very near to the sights of NY or a short cab or subway ride away. Lots of food options around, near to shopping, not far from times Square, etc. - 2 days was simply not enough!!! We will have to make another trip, this time just for the city!

I've always had great meals here, and whenever I thought about the top of my list, this kept popping up in my head. It's delicious and often surprises me with its interesting flavors.

Recently, I suggested this for a friend dinner and my experience completely solidified Oloroso's top billing on my Philly restaurant list. Everything I had was fantastic, but let me point out some standouts.

Squid ink rice, the perfect amount of squid ink taste, rice with a risotto like quality, and perfectly cooked fried calamari on top. 

Charred eggplant, sweet from the honey, interesting spices, a touch of bitter from the char, a flavor combination I feel like I've never had all with eggplant that soaks in all those flavors beautifully.

Coca de recapte: a flatbread with boquerones (anchovies). There's another boquerones dish on the menu, but this is the one to get! The saltiness of the anchovies pairs well with the sweetness of the roasted red peppers and the caramelized onions.

And last but certainly not least, the roasted half pig's head. We decided to splurge and try this. This dish is definitely not for the faint of heart. It's a bit gruesome: They literally bring you a pig's head, teeth and all! Then they carve it tableside, and you're left with juicy, delicious pork. The outside is the crispy pig skin, salty, crunchy, but also sweet from the caramelized gastrique and it's soooooo goodddd.

I knew she was once a famous actress who descended into alcoholism and died tragically.  On the surface the story seems simple, but the complete story of Barbara Payton's life is much more complex and much more compelling.  With the aid of Barbara's family (including her son who had never spoken publicly about his mother before), friends, and co workers, O'Dowd gives a clear, fair view of Barbara and manages to create a tone that is neither overly sympathetic nor overly judgmental.  All in all this is a fine, fascinating biography of a subject whose story I now realize has been overly simplified previously.  There is no doubt that Barbara Payton led a lifestyle that would be considered salacious to most, but, John O'Dowd's biography dims the lights on some of the sensationalism and restored the some respect to the name Barbara Payton.

I have one con: the Samsung App for use with this device is region specific. So have to wait for my return to the US to download.

The music sounds great, especially with Sound Alive.

Battery life is good.  I've been playing it for 7 straight hours since fully charging it.  Manual (off samsung.com) says there's a multi-color  notification using the LED... and ""red"" means over an hour of use. The manual states instructions to change if not in use for a long period to prevent damage to battery.

Reviewers complained that there was no playlist, but it wasn't a secret. I agree with reviewer who said that you won't load an mp3 player with music you don't like. So I chose my ""happy music"" and loaded it up - John Legend, Adele, Machel, Bunji, Buju, Whitney.... as varied as you can get. And when walking, any song would keep me energized!!! I just bought my THIRD Muse...a white to put strictly religious music so I can listen on Sabbath or as needed.  The manual states that you can't determine how songs are actually saved on the device - so don't even try to upload in a particular order.

I love the size. I can close my fist over it.

Once connected to my S3, it shows up as an external storage device that I can copy-paste the songs too. Without the special app. I found it was very fast process.

There are three (3) buttons you need: On/off; Hold (prevents or allows the surface from responding to touch); Straight/shuffle.  I had it for an afternoon and it was easy to remember location and operate.

Read the product description and decide if it's for you! My daughter saw it and I clipped it on the neck of her jersey...I had to beg back for it half hour later. Maybe another Muse is in order, for Mozart and stories for her...hmmmm (I'm very concerned with ear damage if she abuses the volume)

On the face of the player there are five (5) options... very intuitive in my opinion: increase volume at the top, decrease volume at the bottom, skip forward on the right, go back on the left, at the centre play/pause. If you put hold on, none of these will be active to touch while exercising.

Yes, a little pouch to keep attachments would be nice. But you can keep in drawer or those larger chewing gum containers.

c7pT0FVQYBW40hRzzJRDrg,Yelp,"Motoring along the N4, or 4th Street North as locals would call it, there is a two story oasis comfortably cozy with grand oaks, brick and wrought iron fencing. Gaelic winds of whimsy waft skyward and interweave with Southern sultry breeze. 

This Tavern of Isle temptation beckons weary and thirsty travelers off the bustling tarmac and into pub repose. A step off the Saint Pete pace.

Sauntering in with my lovely lass we found a nice niche on the outdoor porch. A great place to take in the charm and envision scenes of yesteryear for this old farmhouse.

The Food. 
My Fab One ordered the Chicken & Cheese Sandwich. Choosing the fried chicken breast with a layer of Cheddar, lettuce, onion and pickle gave her a two wings up combination. I'm always intrigued when my baby is satisfied, and I know that look....

For me, it was a VERY tough call...
I tend to gauge pubs by that infamous dish, The Shepherd's Pie. When I noticed that Three Birds makes a 'true' pie which included lamb, that made it even more tempting! You see, lots of places tout their Shepherd's Pie, but do NOT include lamb. With only beef, the dish is actually a Cottage Pie. Kudos to any establishment that gets it right.

But, I was also titillated by the allure of The Lamb Burger! Nothing beats the sweet note of this 'other' meat treat!

Tormented I was! Like Edgar Allen Poe must've felt trying to come up with a title for 'The Pit and the, hmmmmmm, Clock? No...Second Hand? No...hmmmm.....Pendulum!!!

My Pit(ahem!) chose the Lamb Burger!!! A ground lamb seasoned with red wine, garlic & oregano, topped with Feta cheese, tzatziki sauce, red onion, greens & tomato burger. 
Raising this Three Birds medley to my mouth brought scintillating scents to my olfactory sense! A melting madness of herbal non-verbal discussion deftly danced atop my elated tastebuds...
Oh! The Fantasy of Food!

The Staff.
Tending the chores of this former farmhouse takes a team. Our team member was Kirstin. She handled our requests and our needs like a champ. We walked in as hungry strangers. We left as Pals O' the Pub!

I still would have driven to the south side to get their food though.

As a single mom with 2 teenage boys eating out is usually a burn but at El Guero Canelo I can get the 1/2 a pound Carne Asada  Plate and the 1/2 a pound Chicken plate with extra tortillas and everybody gets stuffed...to the max. The plates come with beans and rice and shredded cabbage and with the salsa bar and veggies there is plenty to go around and it is healthy. 

The salsa bar is soooo generous with fresh cut cucumbers, radishes, limes, red onions, chopped cilantro, shredded cheese, guacamole, 3 or 4 types of salsa including fresh pico de gallo, roasted green onions and roasted jalapenos. Did I mention how generous and fresh these condiments are? 

My family of 4 can sit down and eat an excellent dinner, with drinks and fresh healthy condiments for around 25 bucks and the food is healthier than fast food. Sometimes I take it home with a side of the fresh salsa and veggies and put it in my good ceramic ware and it gets even better because we can eat a beautiful affordable meal in our home together with no fuss or mess besides dishes to rinse and put in the washer.

Our waitress came right over to open our wine, and brought bread to the table.  Then we ordered appetizers, calamari Suppli, & cavatelli carbonara.  All were very good, didn't even get a picture as everyone was starving and it all went quickly.   The bus boys were very quick to remove any finished plates.  The waitress was very quick to refill the kids sodas.  We ordered our entrees and they came out perfect.  I got the chicken piccata and it was delicious, one of the best I've ordered out.  My friend ordered the filet medallions w/ risotto & spinach, I tasted it & that was also delicious, the sauce was very good.  The kids enjoyed their meals.  My husband ordered the strip steak special, he said it was ok, he was impressed with the way it was cooked.   We don't usually do dessert, except when my daughter is with us.  I also had $200 gift card and wanted to make sure I used it all.  We decided on tiramisu, which was very light & very good, and the tres leches cake, this was a very heavy sweet dessert. It was very good and all 6 of us shared these desserts which was plenty after all the food we ate.  Overall, the service was great and the food was delicious.  I will definitely be going back.  It's also BYOB which is nice
     Not sure what took us so long to come back, but took a chance and walked in around 7 last night with no reservation.  They have a 3rd room that is a little different from the other 2 and in the back, the couple in front of us refused to be seated back there.  We didn't care and took the table, it was fine.   It did take about 10 ministers before our server acknowledged us, but after that he was very attentive.  The only complaint about the table is it was veryyyyyy sticky!  I'm not sure why they don't just order more white table cloths and make that room the same as the other 2.   I had the Brussel sprout appetizer and it was delicious, I could have eaten a bowl for as an entree.   The chicken Allora was very good, although there were 2 pieces of chicken and one had a weird texture, not really their fault, as I know from cooking, sometimes you get a bad piece.   My husband said the crab cakes were delicious.   This restaurant is very loud, at least last night.  There were a lot of big parties in there and everyone seemed to be having a great time.

Characters/Story - Jax/Jackson Hart is a firefighter *swoon* who has moved back to NY to be closer to where he grew up. Speaking of, poor guy had a terrible childhood really - except for his bf's family, the Mancini's. Without them, he probably would have starved. But Jax is all grown up now and he's back in town to claim the love from his childhood - Little Frankie Mancini.
Francesca Rebecca ""Becca"" Mancini has been in love with her brother's friend Jax since they were kids. Well... until their first date when he stood her up and she vowed revenge. So, now he's back in town and it looks like she might finally get her chance. If only he didn't look so HOT in that old worn out Rangers tshirt...

My thoughts - I loved Jax, absolutely loved him. He was alpha, humble, patient, a little shy at times, incredibly sexy... everything I have come to expect and LOVE from a Brazen hero. Becca - for the first 2/3 of the book or so, I wanted to throw down with her. It was borderline hatred. She was MEAN. I understand being hurt - but for the love of Moon Pies, woman - listen to his story and GET THE HELL OVER IT! Everyone makes mistakes. And in Jax's situation, there really wasn't much else he could do about it. Ugh. So sad. I cant say anything else because ... well, you know, spoilers.

OY7kYCKpiKuTMmSlO5M7KQ,Yelp,"I was totally disappointed with this salon. I had been looking for a new salon for months. There was a coupon for this salon online so I decided to try it.  At first I was excited because my appointment was with the owner of the salon - so how could she mess up my hair? Right? Wrong! I wanted partial blonde highlights and a touch up of my base color. After 4 hours, I got a patch of gold on the top of my head. Angelina first did my highlights and when I saw them they were brownish/gold. She asked me if it was too brassy and I said yes it is and I was expecting more blonde. She said she would put a toner on it and a few more foils to lighten it up. Well the toner she put on it covered all the highlights she did on the sides of my head. She put foils along my part which made the middle section of my hair completely gold/brassy. This whole process had me there for 4 hours causing me to be late for a family function. Angelina had other customers so her 14 year old daughter was left to wash and shampoo me the second time. Needless to say I got a bath on the right side of my face at one point. Af the end of my appointment I was next to tears and did express that I wanted blonde highlights and that I wasn't happy because my hair was now gold. The kicker is I still had to pay $63 plus tip!!!! I then had to spend another $77 at another salon the next day getting my hair fixed.

Had the scallop special.  Great price for between 6-8 diver scallops.  Was shocked with the amount on the plate as compared to other meals.  Would highly recommend.  Would have loved more sauce with it but the calorie count would have been too high.  Oh well I would still order it again.  Save room for dessert!

AALBQDP9IDKVI,Amazon_Reviews/Electronics,"I purchased a Toshiba 42"" flat panel in February 2007 and didn't purchase the extended warranty, as I reasonably expected a 3 to 5 year service life out of this set. I am sooooooo sorry that I spent one dime on a Toshiba product...

After a mere 18-month period, I was forced to call for repair. A technician diagnosed that my LCD panel failed and that the cost of repair was more than I paid for the TV! A call to Toshiba customer service was met with nothing but frustration. Although out of warranty by a mere six months, the CSR would hear NOTHING of my plea that a $2,200 television should last for more than 18 months and kept repeating that, ""(I)...should have bought the extended warranty."" (Morris is quite a jerk!!!)

A last-ditch effort call to a Toshiba service center revealed the information that Toshiba has problems with ALL of their 42"" televisions. A quick check on main Better Business Bureau website indicates that Toshiba has an ""Unsatisfactory"" rating in resolving customer issues. I only wish I had this information when I purchased this boat anchor and can only wonder how MANY issues Toshiba has!

After learning all of the above, I have begun a letter writing campaign directly to the CEOs of all of the major retailers: Best Buy (where I bought the set), as well as Amazon Sears, Circuit City, etc., informing them that sales such poor-quality products can only hurt their reputation and that they should drop the Toshiba product line altogether.

DO NOT- repeat DO NOT- ever buy a Toshiba product. While it might work well when it works (and I agree with the other reviewers' comments that it's a nice set- BUT ONLY WHEN IT WORKS), quality of manufacture, durability and customer service are other matters altogether.

My advice: spend more and buy a Sony...you'll get your money's worth in the long run and considerate and reasonable treatment from their customer service department.",0,sooooooo,so+,so,I am sooooooo sorry that I spent one dime on a Toshiba product...,I only wish I had this information when I purchased this boat anchor and can only wonder how MANY issues Toshiba has!,0,0,"['I' 'am' 'sooooooo' 'sorry' 'that' 'I' 'spent' 'one' 'dime' 'on' 'a'

Simple, perfect engineering. No macro keys. No multi-media keys other than fn+F#. It is an absolute joy to use. In the last year for my search for the perfect board i have had  two Razer Blackwidow Ultimates, a Logitech g19 and last and absolutely least a Madcatz Strike 7.

The Blackwidow has the most similar feel and construction quality of any competing boards. I feel the Das does have the edge though. Some may feel the Razer makes up for this with its macro keys and touch-sensitive multimedia pad. My media-sensor failed in my first board after 2 years of very heavy use. I found the keys on the Razer had an unusual offset that while i was able to adapt to readily was not nearly as pleasant as the Das's spacing. And it had driver issues to boot.

The Das is often called a Cadillac of keyboards. I would say more of a top of the line German sedan. Comfortable, perfectly built, everything ""clicks"". This has the feel of a ke st or gamer.

Buffalo chicken pizza- dough was awful, tasted like fake, uncooked dough. Wasn't spicy. Chunk chicken. Not cheesy. Not good. Not even worth eating. 

French fries - hand cut. Huge portion. Not served with ketchup. Not offered ketchup. 

Wedge salad - best of the four but still not great. Ran out of dressing. 

They only have ""ranch blue cheese"" dressing. Not one, or the other. So if you're one of those people that only likes one...or the other...you're screwed. I don't like ranch. That was my tough luck because you can only have the combo. 

Out of the four of us, no one really had anything positive to say as far as their food was concerned. 

The place has a cool vibe as far as atmosphere goes but that can only take you so far as far as I'm concerned. 

The bathroom smelled like a cruise ship. Awful. Just warm, bad, unclean air...on January 2nd. 

They are not available on open table. 

I'm giving 2 stars because the dining area seemed clean enough from what we saw and the staff behind the bar and at the front were all friendly. 

I've been putting off coming here for a long time. I wasn't missing anything. It's a hard pass for me in the future. I don't care to return and I wouldn't recommend it.

A32VHRGN91U9FG,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"I loved this book and while I was saddened by certian events, I was  expecting as much. Weis and Hickman are the TRUE gods of Krynn. While the  development in the story and characters wasn't as it was in the  ""gods"" previous Dragonlance books, they were still great. Some  will groan when they read into a few chapters of the book, at the  appearance of a certian Kender, and others we be happy that he is there to  liven things up. The other orignal characters are every bit as enjoyable as  they were before, and for those who loved Raistlin, they are sure to like  the ""new"" Palin. The new characters are great as well, although a  few will take most of the story to actually like. Some reviewers say that  Raistlin will most likely not appear in this series, I beg to differ, if he  were not to make an appearance, or make a big impact in the future novels,  then why would Caramon be SOOOO worried that Raistlin is not there, when he  clearly states that ""everyone"" else is, before he passes. Then he  sends Tas and Gerard off to find out why and what is wrong. This book also  sets off to put in a new god, The One True God. In my oppinon I don't think  the ""new"" god is really all that new, whether the god is some  really powerful old dead mage, Fistandandulas anyone, or someone else who  never ""really"" died, Raistlin, i don't know. Although I don't  think the person can truely be someone who was all evil, as the book  reveals the the ""new"" god is not really evil.

Then we meet our server, and though neither of us could recall meeting him at any other part in our lives, he had developed an active hatred of us somehow. Every second he was forced to be at our table appeared to
be agony for him, I was really concerned for his well being. He rolled his eyes at our drink menu request and ""yeah yeah""ed my dates question about her drink. We wanted to order three or four starters and then entrees once we had a better feel for the menu. Nope, everything at once and if we only wanted the starters, we couldn't sit at a table. ""we know how to course it"" Hmmm, OK, so we ordered 60+ worth of food (though you would have thought we just got chips and salsa based on our server's reaction) and he huffed away. 
After our guacamole came out (it was delicious) the next dish to our table was an entree, no starters in sight. Was this what our server meant by coursing? It was whisked away again and eventually our missing starters appeared. Our server never came over to check on us, I had to flag him down for water, and the only thing he said to us about our entree was ""don't worry this isn't the same one"" meaning to
Kitchen refired the dish I suppose. At that point I was afraid to ask for clarification about anything. When we got close to the end of the meal, a super friendly server came over to clear and asked if we wanted things boxed to take home. He obliged and even joked with us a bit. I would have much preferred he had been our server all earning. As for our assigned server? He dropped the check, ran the card and left us with barely a parting nod. I swear it was as if our table was made of radioactive nightmares. The food was pretty good, not really worthy of the prices charged and especially not if I'm

6472103,TripAdvisor,"On October 11, 2006 we stayed at this hotel. As we were spending several days in New York, we originally thought the $200 a night room rate was a bargain.
On entering the hotel, we felt it was dingy and dark. The lobby furniture if you can call it a lobby was worn and threadbare. The staff was very helpful and pleasant. Sam who was the Valet/ conceierge/etc.etc. seemed very helpful at first. Getting our luggage in the tiny elevator was no easy task. The hallways upstairs were extremely narrow and dark. Our room had to be the worst we had ever stayed in. It was dark and postage stamp small. We could barely get our luggage in there. We were tripping over the luggage constantly. The furniture was old and scratchy, the bedsheets so thin that in certain places they had holes in them. The minutature bathroom was so small you could barely close the door. The shower curtain had a very dirty smell to it. We finally left for the day dreading to come back to the room.
I will tell you that the area was absolutely fantastic!!! Less than a block from Central Park. The Dakota apartment building was right around the corner and subway station less than a block away. The are great restaurants a block or two away on Columbus street. This was a residential area, therefore it was pretty quiet.
The following morning, we decided we did not want to stay there another night. After a free continental breakfast at the hotel which was the biggest perk,( It is hard to find a hotel in New York with a free breakfast) we asked Sam to call us a cab. (BIG MISTAKE) An unmetered cab pulled up and took us to our new destination on East 81st st. 10 or 12 blocks away and the cabbie charged us $45.00 at would have been probably a $12.00 cab ride with a metered cab. We were so upset, we did not even give the cabdriver a tip. We are usually considered big tippers.
In defense of this hotel, the price is cheap by New York standards, the free breakfast and the location make it fine for some travelers, but for us, we will not return.",0,fantastic!!!,fantastic!+,fantastic!,I will tell you that the area was absolutely fantastic!!!,(BIG MISTAKE) An unmetered cab pulled up and took us to our new destination on East 81st st.,1,0,"['I' 'will' 'tell' 'you' 'that' 'the' 'area' 'was' 'absolutely'

SHALLOW GRAVES is the story of a girl named Breezy. Shes just your average teenager who gets murdered and then wakes up a year later in her own grave with the uncanny ability to tell if someone has killed before, and if so, to kill them with a touch. So, you know, typical teenage angst.
Kidding aside, this book is that feeling you get when you walk into a dark room and for a split second before you turn on the light, you aren't quite sure you're alone. I found myself too often reading it late at night, and I could never decide if it was the best idea ever or the worst idea ever, because the experience was so deliciously eerie, buuuut sleep afterwards was a little difficult to come by.

Breezys voice is snarky and fresh, but also achingly poignant at times. In addition to all the bone-chilling creepiness, there are philosophical forays into life, the universe, and everything. The book is in perfect balance. Every single sentence is 100% on point.

I've been gaming at 1080p for a very long time. This is an upgrade from the Asus VG248QE 144Hz. I think this 4K IPS 5ms 60Hz is much nicer compared to 1080p TN 1ms 144Hz. The resolution and IPS image quality makes a much bigger difference. I can still play games like Call of Duty on this 4K 60Hz perfectly fine. The MX27UC has low input lag and great pixel response time. There's no ghosting from what I can tell. I think 144Hz is more of a gimmick. Higher refresh does help reduce screen tearing though. I don't really mind that. It's not that noticeable most of the time. What is always noticeable is 4K IPS. It's so good. The only downside is most websites aren't designed to scale with such a large res. I use the GTX 980 Ti and can max just about every game fine. The image is flawless. There isn't a single thing to complain about. There's no dead pixels or backlight bleeding etc. It's just perfect! My one complaint is I went through two of them to get one that wasn't messed up.

A3MTCPR8DQP984,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"Let me just start off by saying that when I saw this book, I didn't read the blurb or even really pay that much attention to the cover. You know how sometimes, your feet tell you to go somewhere and you do all spontaneously and then something wonderful happens? You meet someone awesome, or have a really fantastic conversation, or try something new that you never would have before?

Had I actually read the blurb, I wouldn't have requested a copy on NetGalley. *shrug* The cover's nice, but doesn't tell me much of anything, and the blurb sounds like soooo many books I've already read! Well, kind of. I could see a few twists, but...Meh! Everyone tries to dig in a few twists, otherwise, we really ARE just writing all the same book.

This book was SO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!! Woooooooow!! OMW! It did take me a bit to get through the first few chapters, but the author had to get everything set up and let's be blunt. My brain isn't what it used to be. It takes me more than a minute to remember who each character is.

I literally had to just grab a hold of my seat and ride it out! Ohhhhh man!! This was a roller coaster I THOROUGHLY enjoyed!! So-so-soooooo much fun! The plot? OMW! There was one point, I looked up from my Kindle and literally said, ""What the frack just happened?"" It wasn't that the writing was bad. It just took me by surprise! Do you know how long it's been since I was surprised by a book? @_@ When Dumbledore died. It's been THAT long!

My honest opinion is this: Pick this book up! Remove all expectations from your mind. Get your brain out of the box. Open it up. And then enjoy this wild-WILD ride! OMW! Mind. Blowing!

The range of the sensor is about 1,000 feet with an unobstructed view. It works great through windows. The more walls you try to pass through the less likely the signal is going to reach your car. 

The system also replaces your automatic car door opener and alarm if you previously had those features on your car. I can't remember the price. I believe it was $199.99 for the product. The amount for the installation escapes me. Nevertheless, it was well worth the cost.

s3bwD1BZSF1uI9mOrwP8yw,Yelp,"Absolutely frustrated with today's service so let me rant. First, we bought our car in July 2019 and advised around August that we heard a rattle with one of the rear vents. That part has been in order since with absolutely no ETA. I cannot fathom how a brand new model car cannot have a part already and the item be replaced. Second, dropped my car off today for a noise in the steering column when I turn. They got that part in quickly and was replaced today along with an airbag recall. When we dropped the car off we specifically asked to also re-coat the clear coating that we purchased through a warranty we purchased when we purchased the car. We got the call that the car was ready and asked about if they did the coating as well. Nope! Have to schedule that for another time. Why they didn't say this when we dropped it off. Have no freaking clue. When we arrived to get the car, we are told that we'd have to work with the finance department on scheduling that then told that actually they don't do the re-coating unless something is fixed. Ummm per co website for the coating this has to be reapplied every 6 mos. Decided to just look into and take it up later. Third, when picking up the car we are told that they had to take the headliner off for the airbag and the cords we had installed for a dash cam were laying in the floor since they weren't sure if we wanted reinstalled. WTF the car was perfect when we dropped it off so now you think that because you didn't know if we wanted it to be reinstalled. What do you think!? Ummmm hell yes it needs to be put back in how it was when I dropped it off. Omfg. So I asked why they didn't call as they could've called and asked. He just apologized and said he'd take the blame. Fourth, get into my car and it's not vacuumed which it has been every other time I have brought it in. And there is dirt that the service person obviously tracked into my car and into the back area. There is trash in the back that they didn't remove. What level of service is this!?

I read their ""1 year free labor and parts"" service policy, and find out that I have to pay about $40 shipping fee to get it repaired.

Any way, the point is: Buy this thing is a kind of taking your own risk thing, totally depend on luck. If you have bad luck, like me, the device will not last more than half year!

A19JGPUJAX048H,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"Rachel Porter is a special agent for the US government.  Big deal, you say.  Been there, done that.  However, Rachel is a special agent for the US Fish & Wildlife Service - not one of the typical literary government crime-busting agencies.  This allows the author to approach the crime from a completely different direction, which was a nice change of pace.
The characters were interesting.  Rachel is a person who is used to running from her problems, and here she's forced to make a choice and decide whether or not to take a stand.  Her boss, who initially seemed like a stereotypical boss from hell, has depth to his character.  The detective in charge of the investigation is not one of the usual stalwart heroes - there are a lot of dark shadings to his character.  The secondary characters all have their own charm.
The story takes place in New Orleans and its surrounding swamplands.  Rachel is called in when a dead alligator is found at the scene of a murder - a hooker has beeen ritualistically slashed to death.  The story begins with that and then takes off into political corruption, murder, drug running, neo-Nazis, and the Mob.  The descriptions of the people, politics and places are vivid and realistic.

Thought the $37 fee was a decent low price for a public course - little did I know it would be the worst $37 I've ever spent.  I've been playing golf for over 20 years - playing mostly public courses around the Philadelphia area, and never in my life have I seen such a run down crappy course.  There wasn't a single hole with grass on the fairway, I mean that literally.  We were playing ""plug and place"" rules usually only deemed necessary when there's been a serious rainstorm and the ball plugs in the fairway.  We instead played if you hit the fairway, you can pick the ball up and move it to the nearest grass area within 50 ft (50ft!!) and even with that rule, I still threw my ball into the rough most of the time because that was the only grass I could find.  I can't believe Springfield is charging people to play this course, I'd rather have just played in the parking lot.  No drinking water anywhere on the course, and the the final kicker, was that the ranger was more concerned about my driving the cart off the path than he was keeping pace of play - when we got to the 14th tee box - there were 4 groups on waiting to tee off!!!

p5NiZtwC0krZsXvvy21w5g,Yelp,"Yum! I was on Jefferson's campus looking for a bite to eat with a friend and we agreed on Thai - this place was a great choice!

I ordered the Tom Yum soup and the fried dumplings and my friend got the Penang Curry. The Tom Yum soup was incredible, flavor wise. The one thing I did not enjoy about it was the shrimp in the soup was not de-tailed so it was kind of awkward digging into my soup and getting it out and having to do this. I ended up just not eating the shrimp because of how messy it was and also it kinda tasted like frozen shrimp tossed into my hot soup (not fresh). Otherwise, though, the soup was excellent...Maybe they should just nix the shrimp as an ingredient? The dumplings at first tasted good but once they cooled down a bit were just fried dough with random, somewhat flavorless stuffing so I only ended up eating about half of them.

The Penang curry, however, redeemed the dumplings! I normally do not like coconut or coconut flavored things. This, however, was delicious!!! It was served with your typical white rice in a pot and was so perfect. Must. try. It has slightly redeemed coconut for me and I find myself wishing I had ordered the same thing.

The service was prompt and the waiter was friendly and attentive (as much as he could be - he was often slightly delayed due to a very big party next to us but that clearly wasn't his fault). When we wrapped up, he gave us 10% discount for being Jefferson students just because he saw our IDs - we did not know about the discount and hadn't asked for it and I thought this was awesome so he gets five stars (wish I would've caught his name...next time). He also was very helpful with the spice level. He suggested a lower spice level (3) then what we were going for (4) and turned out to be right, but brought out hot sauce for us just incase he was wrong and we wanted more spice (we didn't). 

The inside is a lot nicer than what we expected with soft lighting and modern seating. It's not what you expect based on the sign/outside. There are two full screen TVs above the bar and a whole back dining area. 

All in all, this place seems to have some fabulous but also some sub par menu items so if you feel like having some Thai food in the area, I would definitely give it a shot.",1,delicious!!!,delicious!+,delicious!,"This, however, was delicious!!!",The inside is a lot nicer than what we expected with soft lighting and modern seating.,1,1,"['This,' 'however,' 'was' 'delicious!!!']",[1 1 1 5],1,1,0,5.0,4,16,433

A381C6UUUIAB4V,Amazon_Reviews/Electronics,"I backed up a Norton backup from my secondary 1TB internal hard drive onto an external Seagate GoFlex 3TB hard drive. It took 11 hours and 38 minutes. That is a loooonnnngggg time. My backup HDD was almost full and that was with only two backup file/folders, so I decided to store the older file that I had started in 2011, that included pictures and music and took up a lot of memory. I recently decided to start a new backup; September 2015, which sucked up about 250GB, but archived the older 735GB folder.

I have an older EVGA X58 SLI x3 motherboard that I bought in April 2009. It has the Intel i7 920 Nehalem 2.66GHz quad processor with 12 GB DDR3 1600 mamory. My backup HDD is a WD 1TB, but it is not the black. I must have just missed the newer X58 motherboard (MB) that came with USB 3.0 and only so I only have USB 2.0. No, I never got around to doing any over-clocking with this MB or adding more graphics cards to the SLI 2 or 3 slots. I don't do any gaming to speak of or any graphic arts that require that kind of fun.

I decided it was time to upgrade my USB as I don't have the necessity to build a new computer, so I got this USB 3.0 card and installed it in the available secondary  x16/x8 PCI Express 2 slot. I thought about trying it in the third x8 slot, but I read it needed to be in the x16, if not in the x1 slot, and I had other chores to perform. Unfortunately, this motherboard only has one PCI express x1 slot and it is covered by my GTX 285 video card.
Anyway, I used the 4 pin to SATA power adapter cable, loaded the drivers from the CD and everything worked great.

While I had hoped for a bit more speed, with the USB 3,  the transfer to the Seagate went from 11+ hours to 4 hours and 15 minutes for the same file, which I deleted afterwards; only need 1. Anyway, I'll take the 2.5x faster speed. I'll update if I have any issues.",1,loooonnnngggg,lo+n+g+,long,That is a loooonnnngggg time.,It has the Intel i7 920 Nehalem 2.66GHz quad processor with 12 GB DDR3 1600 mamory.,0,1,['That' 'is' 'a' 'loooonnnngggg' 'time.'],[1 1 1 4 2],0,1,0,4.0,5,16,369

We decided to start with the charbroiled oysters and ordered a few of their wines our server suggested. The oysters looked good but they were cold and lacked flavor. We waited awhile for these to come out considering they were ordered as an appetizer. Initially I was very upset and didn't understand what my family and fellow yelpers had been raved about. Our server brought over a member of the the management staff after seeing how disappointed we were with the drinks and oysters. Miss Jaqueline assured us she would handle everything and we waited no more than 5 minutes for freshly made oysters and differing wine samples so we could find something we actually enjoyed. She truly listened to our concerns . Let me tell you the second time around it was as if we entered a new restaurant oysters were cooked to perfection and full of flavor. I enjoyed a glass of Casa Branca which I believe is local, it was absolutely delish! The entrees came out perfectly and the lobster ravioli was to DIE for!!! If the meal had continued as it began I can assure you I would never come back. After my experience I understand why this place has such good reviews. The manager Jaqueline was extremely understanding and made this experience for me. She took care of my family and was committed to ensuring the whole experience was perfect and went above and beyond.

A3CYW3SYC4DR50,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"I finally got my hands on Heavenly which I've been looking forward to reading for the longest. Heavenly was soooo good, the cover doesn't do it justice and you can barely see Matthias on the cover, I wish it was a little better but this is one of those books that shouldn't be judged by it's cover.

Zoe is an angry teenager that's tired of having to take care of her little autistic sister and thinks that the only way to forget about her life at home is to get drunk with her friend Britt and fool around with random guys. I did NOT like Zoe from the very beginning she was awful and she irritated the heck out of me.  I thought she was selfish and insensitive with those awful things that she kept thinking about her little sister and how she felt embarrassed of her and hid her from her friends. I nearly put the book down several times and almost stopped reading it, I'm glad I didn't because eventually she grew on me after she met Matthias.

 Once Zoe starts seeing Matthias around and comes to terms with the fact that he's her little sister's guardian angel I could definitely see the beginning of changes in her. They weren't sudden, she starts slowly, and she still makes the wrong choices a few times specially when she got mad. Zoe begins to realize after a while that her brother is not the only one with a problem, but that she also has an addiction with alcohol. I really liked the way we get to see the changes in her and how Matthias helps her make the right choices, the descriptions of how she feels every time she's around her make it really hard for the reader to not fall in love with Matthias yourself.

Heavenly had a little bit of a religious feel to it, but it wasn't like it was trying to preach any religion to the reader or make you feel guilty about not going to church. It does certainly make you think about what's really important in life while you're reading it and how you shouldn't take the love of your family for granted and try to see things in a nicer and different way. My favorite parts were about Abria, Zoe's little sister, I really loved the part when Matthias explains to Zoe about what goes on in her mind and how Abria really feels. There is a little twist in the story that made me cried of course, I'm such a sap! I definitely recommend this one to everyone, it's a beautiful story about love, family bond, and personal growth.",1,soooo,so+,so,"Heavenly was soooo good, the cover doesn't do it justice and you can barely see Matthias on the cover, I wish it was a little better but this is one of those books that shouldn't be judged by it's cover.",I thought she was selfish and insensitive with those awful things that she kept thinking about her little sister and how she felt embarrassed of her and hid her from her friends.,1,0,"['Heavenly' 'was' 'soooo' 'good,' 'the' 'cover' ""doesn't"" 'do' 'it'

I have really enjoyed all of the Legal Brief stories and this one was no exception. I not only connect with the characters, but really get emotionally involved.  Leary and Reeve are both lawyers in this story, only they are lawyers on the same case but on opposite sides.  Both are very headstrong people and I liked that they had their lives together.  They weren't ""broken souls"" as many romance books are now.  I liked that they were both strong characters and characters you could admire.  As always, Ms Bennett weaves a strong love story into the plot with enough conflict to keep me turning the pages.  Enjoyed it very much and think many others will too.

I ordered speedy Gonzales so I could taste their sauce.  It was orange and tangy not a robust red chilli sauce.  
Hubby ordered chicken chimichanga as his staple tester.

But looking inside it's like an old bar repurposed.  
The bar is large and well stocked.

The rice is yellow rice.  Not Sysco rice out of a prepackaged order.  
My only real complaint is the rice tasted like it had been thrown on the same grill as Shrimp was just fried on.  I saw the shrimp come out and delivery to another table.  
I could have been allergic to shellfish and had an episode allergy or gone to hospital.

A14QMFZW9GWNL7,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"First of all, I really wanted to read this book after reading the editorial ""book jacket"" description. But just 25 pages into the book, something wasn't right. The author is an amateur writer who states the obvious again and again, incorporates inane dialogue and never fully gets the reader to give a damn about what happens to any of the characters. I can honestly say that there is not one character in the book that I liked. The main character, Sarah, is one dimensional and downright cold. Her conversations with her husband, Shiloh (the cop who ""goes missing"" and is the focus of the book) read like two distant relatives. Her cop partner, Genevieve, is equally as cold and unfeeling with zero dimension. Why these two would be ""friends"" is beyond me except that ""like attracts like"" I suppose. While I read a great deal of thriller/mystery fiction, I guessed the big ""twist"" midway in the book. However, without giving anything away, the author seems to be leading the reader to the conclusion that Shiloh committed an even bigger crime than he did (i.e., the murder of another younger character in the book). Why else  would the author continue to tell us about his ""penetrating glances"" at the young girl during their Christmas Eve dinner? But this is just one of MANY false stops the author throws into the book. We are forced to read endless tidbits of other missing persons cases that Sarah dealt with but  only ONE of them is mentioned as having meaning toward the end of the book and even that one is a kind of  ""Who cares?"" In fact, ""Who cares?"" basically describes this entire book.

Downsides: the shop has a strange, narrow setup, which, I get is a natural limitation of the space, but, the way the shop is set up, the main seating area is in the back - and without windows, it's claustrophobic & crowded. The seating should be in the FRONT, kitchen in the back. Along the bar there are a few high tables, but that puts you right in the face of people placing (errrr, shouting) their orders. 

Which brings us to downside 2: the radio was turned up SO LOUD to talk radio/commercials/sports game that we couldn't hear ourselves think at our table and folks placing their orders were literally shouting over the din!!! The cashier would say ""what? WHAT?"" with ever-increasing volume/irritation.  All they had to do was turn down the radio a bit, then customers don't need to yell, and the cashier wouldn't get annoyed with the customers for not being loud enough. THINK, McFly!  

And downside 3 - SLOW service. We only ordered 2 juices, with only 2 people waiting ahead of us. We waited 15 minutes AFTER placing our order due to the kids behind the counter chatting it up - with each other & with customers - and not getting much done. 

Note to the owners: while we were there, a customer brought a dog INSIDE the restaurant. He was on a leash, not in arms, and NOT a service dog. One employee stopped working, came around the counter, chatted w/the customer, & patted the dog. She did wash her hands before returning to work, but YUCK! Dogs do NOT belong in eating facilities.

You might pay teenagers less to work, but that doesn't mean you should train them less.

Decided to try Logan Electric.  Located in Jenkintown on the busy Old York Road, the parking area is only in the back of the stores for the surrounding businesses.
Upon trying to enter,  you have to ring the bell. The lady said it's so her dog won't run out the store, but I'm pretty sure it's more then that.
The lady was waiting on a customer and talking sooooo much that I had to interrupt just to ask if she carried under cabinet lighting.  She said yes, so I waited and looked around the store. I noticed that there were no price tags on anything  (which is strange). After being there for what seemed an eternity and (clearly overpricing the poor women customer) I had made up my mind that I won't buy anything from this place. 
Anyway, when she finally looked at the kind of bulb I needed, she didn't have them in stock, but could order them. Saying "" Oh, those bulbs are expensive ""! I quickly told her they were not and they only cost less than $2 a bulb. 
I left this store mad and exhausted! 
She wasted my time and tried to take advantage of me.
I saw a few things that I liked enough to buy, but they would never get my business. She can charge whatever she likes with no price tags!
I really feel she thinks she is giving great customer service,  but she talks way too much! So sorry I didn't get her name, but that's ok because she'll never see me again!

Ok I admit I wasn't the biggest fan of Ghost Story, kind of an understatement really but it did inspire a little fear as to  whether I was going to continue enjoying one of my favorite series.  That fear was for nothing, Harry is back along with his posse that I missed so much in Ghost Story and up until I read Cold Days I didn't think any book could be as good or better than Changes.

While almost every Dresden book is filled with action from cover to cover and this one is no exception, it has sooooooo much more.  Harry is now the Winter Knight for Queen Mab  and the Mantle of the Winter Knight  turns most who have it into a complete and utter jerk and while Harry at heart has always been a nice guy he has challenges fighting what the Mantle wants him to do.  The mantle gives a whole lot more understanding of what his brother Thomas goes through constantly, oh and Thomas is back in this book fighting along side Harry and the reunion scene was awesome.

This book ties so many story lines together that have been in previous books and answers so many questions while still having a killer cast of bad guys.  You find out so much more about the Sidhe, the island Harry is tied to, the Black Council and who is the new big bad that has been organizing events throughout most of the previous thirteen books.  Don't get me wrong while it answers a bunch of questions it also leaves you wanting more... sooo much more.

Cold Days also has some humor, the usual one liners and pop culture references that are so amusing.  One of the reasons I liked this book so much is that while Jim Butcher could always write a killer action scene he's getting better with the emotional aspects of Harry's character.  Harry has to deal with his relationships with other people in this book and he is forced to learn that his actions have consequences involving more than just his friends' safety but the relationship between them as well.

The ending....holy s*** the ending.  While it is not the cliff hanger we got in Changes thankfully, it definitely set up the story line for future books and there are some big changes that have happened!  Cold Days is to date my favorite in the series and thus begins the wait for book 15....sigh.",1,sooo,so+,so,sooo much more.,"Ok I admit I wasn't the biggest fan of Ghost Story, kind of an understatement really but it did inspire a little fear as to  whether I was going to continue enjoying one of my favorite series.",1,0,['sooo' 'much' 'more.'],[5 3 3],1,0,0,3.0,3,37,437
106279861,TripAdvisor,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel last night because we wanted to make an early trip to take some of our son's things home from a college in the area. The area was ok although not anything around to do or eat without getting into your car or using the T. They had free parking which was good since almost every hotel charges you for parking. When we first walked into the room, my first impression was ehhh, it isn't as bad as I thought it would be since I got a little nervous when we pulled up seeing the hotel from the outside. The room looked clean enough, was tastefully decorated and had a refrigerator and microwave. When I went into the bathroom there were ants all over the floor. I killed about 15 of them. That wasn't too bad, I was more concerned with bed bugs... I checked but thank goodness didn't find any. I did find more ants though, crawling on the chair next to the bed. After being itchy all night thinking about ants crawling on me, I slept with my clothes on and sweatshirt hood on my head. That wasn't the worst of it though...during the night I kept getting a faint smell of vomit. I don't know if it was on the rug on my side of the bed or the side of the chair or on the mattress. It wasn't a strong odor but every so often kept getting a whiff. I couldn't figure out where it was coming from, disgusting! I should have asked for another room but quite frankly didn't think it would make much of a difference and I figured they didn't have one since they told me that they were booked when I called. We were only going to be there for a night anyway. To top it off, when we went to grab something to eat, we saw a huge rat in the parking lot. If anybody could have seen me sleeping, you would have laughed at the lunatic sleeping in her clothes with her hood tied up tight, wrinkling up her nose from the puke smell...with one eye open worried about rats coming through the bottom of the door. I've been dragging my rear end all day from lack of sleep then had a 5 hour drive home. To be honest with you, I wouldn't have been so harsh with my review if there were no ants or puke smell, it wouldn't have been too bad because it was surprisingly clean otherwise.",0,"ehhh,","eh+,","eh,","When we first walked into the room, my first impression was ehhh, it isn't as bad as I thought it would be since I got a little nervous when we pulled up seeing the hotel from the outside.",I don't know if it was on the rug on my side of the bed or the side of the chair or on the mattress.,1,0,"['When' 'we' 'first' 'walked' 'into' 'the' 'room,' 'my' 'first'

And then, about halfway into the book, the story made a sudden turn into la-la land.  With sermons about Jesus and entire passages of the new testament read out loud.  It was ridiculous!!!  When I did more research, I found out the author is a Jew for Jesus and that the book was published by a Christian publishing house.  I was so annoyed, I didn't even want to finish listening to the rest of it.  The only thing more annoying would be for Mr. Rosenberg to show up at my house and try and convert me in person.

This is not an isolated issue and Seagate hasn't been able to solve this although it has been reported for more than a year ago.
If you bought one, and are having issues with it, RETURN IT IMMEDIATELY! If you try getting support, Seagate will drag the issue for months asking you to install 3rdparty software that won't solve the problems until you run out of time to return the drive.

We hit up the Arts and Crafts first and I was impressed by the selection.  Lots of snacks (nuts, popcorn, sauces, candy, etc.), clothing, toys, decorations, etc.  I ended up buying a dutch oven pot, Angry Bird keychains and popcorn.  I could have gone crazy, but I resisted the urge!

We ate at the Checkered Pig first and had the Rib Sampler and 1/2 a dozen of Hush Puppies.  Loooove the sauce!  Great taste and doesn't taste store bought like some of the other ones did.  I'm actually planning on going back to buy the sauce.  And the Hush Puppies ... what can I say?  Pretty good flavor, but really though ... how can you go wrong with Hush Puppies?!

We also stopped by the Carson City rib booth and tried their Rib Sampler as well as a Chicken Kabob.  I was slightly disappointed with their sauce.  The ribs were tender and chicken was cooked good, but in my opinion, I think their sauce tasted store bought.  I apologize in advance because I'm sure there's some Carson City rib lovers on here that have now put a hit out on me.

Lastly, we ended up getting Fried Mushrooms and a Strawberry Funnel Cake.  Fried Mushrooms didn't have much flavor and they were what they were.  Just battered mushrooms deep fried.  At least we tried them, but we had high hopes and were slightly disappointed.  The Strawberry Funnel Cake was super filling!  It was cooked perfectly ... it was fresh and just crunchy enough.  

We also scored some ""official gear"" for this cook off with a mens t-shirt, pig beaded necklace and a rib cook offf pin.  We drove to Reno for this event, might as well remember it!

Overall, we loooved this festival.  Everyone would always talk about it and we fiiinally made it out.  I'm pretty impressed and now would like to see what the next years cook off will bring.  On that note, we're going back tomorrow to hit up some other booths we wanted to try but had no room in our bellys.

Helpful tip:  Bring an umbrella for shade when you walk/wait in lines and a chair to sit on.  Seating seemed to be very limited so racing for a seat once someone gets up is never fun.  Ribs and sides are hard to eat!  I'm surprised they didn't offer more tables/chairs.  That's the only downside.

A39SFMBQ9LW6B3,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"I have read most of David Bach's books and believe Fight for Your Money is one of the most useful and insightful books he has written. Fight for your Money is a must read for everyone!!! David went above and beyond in providing fantastic and insightful advice on saving money for everything we pay for. He provides simple actions and explains exactly how to go about saving money on everything from cell phone plans, to credit cards rates, banking and everything in between. After reading his book I made a list of companies to call and in the first call to my cell phone carrier I took his advice and saved $30 a month on my bill and ended up getting a much better plan. That is a savings of at least $360.00 a year not including all the extra fees I would have paid in extra minutes. Considering it took me about five minutes to make the call I was overwhelmed with how easy his strategies were to execute.

By using David's strategies to get a better deal at hotels, I was rewarded with a much better room at an incredible rate. I simply asked at the front desk for a better rate than what they quoted me on the phone and if I could get an upgrade since I was a loyal customer.  Again his strategies worked. They accommodated me with a beautiful suite with two bathrooms and and an Oceanview.  All for a lower price than what I was quoted on the phone for a regular room. All this with relatively little haggling and because I ASKED to get a better deal. The reality is and David points it out again and again, these companies do not want us to get a better deal, but a better deal that can save you money is out there.  By reading Fight for Your Money he gives you the advice and guidance to SAVE YOU MONEY and in many instances A LOT of MONEY . If anyone knows what they are doing in regards to helping you save money and live a better life it is without a doubt David Bach.

Everything was clean and tidy. I personally think the floor was getting done up at the time mind, there were painters around in the corridors all week. 
NYC you basically need a place to shower and crash, thats all we wanted. WE GOT ALOT MORE THAN THAT. IF you go to NYC and worry about what the inside of the hotel is like, its kinda worrying. You sleep in the hotel and thats about it.

Checked in later in the day, they had taken messages for us which was good, and minded our luggage.

In a great location, not near all the action but on the same street as a FANTASTIC pizza place (biggest pizzas i've ever seen!) and loads of restaurants/shops/supermarkets just around the corner. could easily walk to Times Square and central park is just across the rd. could walk to the opera, museums and big shopping centres.

Could You believe for 6 containers of Sushi between 2 people, spending 90 dollars, the rude witch at the cashier only gave us 4 little packets of soya sauce!? And when I asked for more soya sauce she gave me one more with a nasty attitude. I was forced to eat half of my sushi with no soya sauce, because the two packets she gave me ran out mid way. I have never in my life had such an issue at any other sushi restaurant. She really ruined the experience and my dinner for the night. How does a person enjoy sushi with no soya sauce. Not just the soya sauce but the ginger and wasabi was very minimal as well. I really feel that woman that served me acted in the way she did because she is a rascist. From the time I walked in I received an attitude from her and there was no reason for it other than her being a rascist. DO NOT come to this place if you don't want to face discrimination, and sushi without soya sauce in 2017 almost 2018. Shame on this establishment for the way they treated me and my friend. There should be no room for discrimination and rascism in this day and age, especially in a place like Canada.

Those who know me know that I am normally afraid to read a KA book because I am a slow reader and the length of her books scare me. :)  Now, I listened to my friends as they kept saying you have to start this one next...you have to...you have to. So I did.

Indeed I fell in love. I was skeptic in the beginning because I was not feeling it but then I arrived to chapter 3 and alas I could not put the darn book down. It really takes me a while to read long books and I indeed finished this book in 3 days which is not bad at all considering I am SLOW.

Now with the book. I have only read the Dream Man series so I am not much of an expert in KA men as my friends are but damn did I not fall in love with Jake Spears. I also ended up loving Josephine as well; considering she was on my nerves in the beginning. She turned out to be the best. The way she spoke and was well versed in her conversations and to be so blinded to what was indeed happening around her is what made her more likable in my opinion.

I loved how KA dragged emotions out of me; I laughed, I cried, I was scared, I was giddy, I felt my stomach drop on more than one occasion; I believe you get the drift. KA kicked butt in this book on bringing out all these emotions out of me and with that being said I LOVE IT when an author can do that. Loved this book hard.

The guy I spoke with (who is apparently the owner) told me they had a team who had a light, quick move that morning and they could get there afterward...probably no later than 12:00.  He also went on and on that other movers charge extra fees for the movers' time to get to your house and back to the office after the move, that he doesn't charge.  Soooo, the day of the move, they arrived at 2:15, which meant we hit I-24 at the height of rush hour.  It took them an hour and a half to make the 38 mile drive.  Then when it came time to pay, there was an extra $118. they said was for travel time.  They put me on the phone with the owner who stated he told me there was a one time $118 fee (above and beyond the the hourly fee). I pointed out to him that his selling point was that they didn't charge for travel time as other movers did and he only told me it would be $118 an hour.
Then after they left, I noticed the new 45"" flat screen TV was broken...had a crack in the screen and would turn on but the screen was too damaged to show a picture.  I texted a picture of it to the guys who moved me and he said he would tell the office.  But I heard nothing back.  A few weeks later, I again emailed the office letting them know a TV was broken.  Crickets.  I suppose it doesn't matter since they told me ahead of time they pay .60 a ""pound"" for damaged items.  So they would only pay about $9.00 for a 15 lb broken TV. So if you have a 1 pound priceless vase, you're only going to get .60 if they shatter it.

AT5P0IXHIDELX,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"--<< ""I also don't like that she admitted to never feeling anything, because I can honestly say when I'm around her, I've never felt so much.""  - Dean Holder >>--

OH.MY.GOODNESS. Where do I start?

First of all, this is not an ordinary retelling of Hopeless. It's Holder's story- one driven by guilt, remorse, and a love that never faded.  It's a story of healing, and one of many forte's that Colleen Hoover has in her storytelling.  We get to FEEL Holder's pain and his thought processes as he comes to face-to-face with grieving his sister's death, finding Hope, and the revealing of his relationship with her. And how he goes through it, his journey? It was so painfully, heart-grippingly, tearfully beautiful. You'll fall in love again.

--<< ""I love you, too,"" she says, proving to me that words are yet another characteristic someone can fall in love with. But I'm not falling in love with her piece by piece anymore. I'm in love with the whole girl. Every single piece of her.  >>--

And don't forget CoHo's knack for creating awesome characters. We never really saw much of Daniel in Hopeless, but wish I had - he was HYSTERICAL! The banter between him and Holder was a great comic-relief in the midst of the heavier, more emotional scenes. If only he and Six would have met each other ... Hmmmmm that could make a good story (CoHo if you're reading this: hint,hint!)

Overall ""Losing Hope"" is A MUST-READ, BUT only after Hopeless. The final chapters really do bring an enormous sense of closure to Hope & Holder's story and, in my opinion, one can only truly appreciate it's full meaning with knowing Hope's story first.",1,Hmmmmm,Hmm+,Hmm,"Hmmmmm that could make a good story (CoHo if you're reading this: hint,hint!",Where do I start?,1,0,"['Hmmmmm' 'that' 'could' 'make' 'a' 'good' 'story' '(CoHo' 'if' ""you're""

We got the room for $65 a night which seemed like a great rate considering how much it normally costs to reserve a room at this hotel. First off I have to say the night staff is horrible!!! absolutely horrible. I called 5 times to get a crib delivered!!! When it finally was delivered we were out at dinner and I come back to the room and see the most beat up, stained Pack n Play I've ever seen! So I open it up in disgust to see the condition of the inside and there are pincher bugs crawling around in it! I immediately called the front desk to have someone pick it up and deliver another one. I told him about the bugs and he didn't even apologize. It took over an hour to get the crib, meanwhile by 2 year is exhausted and needs to go to bed and I have no crib!! The next pack n play delivered was in better shape but still stained in spots, so I wiped it down with antibacterial wipes and used by crib sheets i brought from home. We also traveled with my parents and my brothers family. The garbage in their rooms didn't get emptied each day or hotel products refilled. I had no kleenex refills or soap. I had to call down to the front desk again the next night to have some delivered. I heard the same front desk agent as the prior night exhale a sigh in disgust when I asked him for the soap and kleenex. The carpet is extremely dirty and not vacuumed each day. The room is cramped and small. There is no closet only a small wardrobe in the corner. The cable came in fuzzy, might as well not have even had a TV in the room. The bed was uncomfortable and the sheets were just sad. I wasn't even warm at night they were so thin.

A1OKLRMMO6A8PQ,Amazon_Reviews/Electronics,"I bought 3 of these for a bedroom LED.  As most people are aware, LED's, LCD's, and other flat-panels do not have the premium sound they advertise or that is offered by complete home theater set up.  So, I bought these to complement a Sony receiver whereby I could increase the volume of the center channel while lowering the overall volume to allow for easily discernible speech while not being overpowered by sound effects (""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring,"" would be a perfect example!).  These speakers were so easy to set up, they have a very good weight to them, and they sound fantastic.  Also, the weight is enough to not allow the speaker to slide around on a flat surface.

Who should buy these?
Anyone looking to have better sound for a flat panel television in either a bedroom or other smaller room.  I'm not sure I would recommend these for a larger living room setup.  If you want small speakers for a large room, you have to go with Bose.  I've had Bose Acoustimass II cubes for 17 years and they play perfectly!

Do you need a subwoofer with these?
It depends!  If these are for your primary home theater set up, then you must get a powered subwoofer as no home theater is complete without a powered subwoofer.  For my bedroom, I did some testing of various films and I found I do not need a subwoofer for the bedroom.  Note that my stereo receiver can adjust the bass and treble.  I turned the bass up to 10 and Treble to a negative 7 and I had rather good bass and sound going so I saved about $100 (at least) for not having to get a subwoofer.

The overall sound is very good and using only three speakers (Front Left, Front Right, Center), I had a very good experience.  For price, brand reputation, and sound, I gave these speakers 4 stars.  I did not give 5-stars because depending on your needs, these may not match exactly what you are needing.  If you are needing just some satellites for a smaller room or perhaps to complement a larger home theater system, then upgrade the review to 5-stars.

A2NUC25JBM1GJM,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"I'm in Florida visiting my mom on my yearly vacation to the beach.  She has this book sitting on her coffee table, so I pick it up to read.  I couldn't put it down!  I carried it to the beach, I took it everywhere and finished it in a couple of days!  One reviewer called her all kinds of names (this reviewer HAS to be a man!), which kind of hurt my feelings because after reading this book I realize Teri and I are 99.9% alike!  Frankly I find that to be GOOD news because I like myself, and to have so much in common with someone like her is a huge compliment to say the least!!  I'm recently divorced with a very young daughter, so this book was like Chicken Soup for the Soul for me (no pun intended).  It left me feeling like my mistakes in life haven't been failures, they've been opportunities to grow and learn.  She did a fantastic job with this book!  I mean I find it gutsy to lay it all out there for the entire world to read.  I don't know if I could do it!

As I have said in previous reviews, I'm not a big reader.  This one reeled me in though, so buy it!  I learned that no matter how ""rich and famous"" you may be, or how beautiful, we ALL still have the same basic human principles of being insecure, some days feeling not so sexy, trying to be the perfect parent, etc. etc.  I needed this book at this particlar time in my life, so THANK YOU Teri Hatcher.

I saw these in the search and starting looking into them and saw that the reviews and what it states is way better than any cooler pad.  So I decided to take a chance on it and purchase.  I can't be more happy with this.  I normally play starcraft and heroes of the storm on my laptop and about an hour of game play the whole laptop is hot, it starts radiating heat from the bottom and the I feel the heat on the keyboard...  But with this!!! - It barely feels warm after a few hours, there is a HUGE difference in temperature of my laptop with this.  It is a little loud if you had absolutely nothing else on.  But once the game music and game sounds are on you don't even notice at all.  Though underneath the cooling pad where the fixed mount is suppose to be secured - a little blue grommet went missing.  It helps keep the fixed mount secured to the cooler pad.  Even with it missing I haven't had any problems with it.  I will be purchasing more of these maybe in a higher end range.  But I just wanted to see if this actually worked for my laptop without spending too much just yet.  This is well worth the price!

""The Prince who brought the tabloids and dirty blogs more gossip than a hundred celebrity wardrobe malfunctions.""

Ohh goodness...I just loved reading this book!! This story was soo much fun and filled with lots of craziness, alpha male, hawt sex and fun cat and mouse play!!!

This story is about Prince Silas Bearington, heir to the island's throne. He is the crazzzy playboy prince with the bad reputation that the towns people are not very happy with and they definitely do not want him to be king.

There is a chance meeting with an intern. A very pretty intern. Prince Silas decides that this intern is going to change his public reputation and hope to change the perception of what the people think of him and in turn that the town will fall in love him. But oohhh what crazzzy events that end up happening along the way and hope that all that has been put in place really does get the Prince in good graces with the people!! You will just have to read the book to find out!! : )

The Revd Neville Barker Cryer has been a Mason for over 50 years and shares his long Masonic experience in Mark Masonry with you within the pages of this remarkable book. Topics include: The Use of the Mark, The Cornerstone, The Overseers, The Mark Master's Apron, The Keystone(or Plug), and much, much, more. For example, talking about the Overseers, Brother Cryer states; ""In another talk in this series it was pointed out that there was not just one mark but three on an approved stone. The second of those marks was the one we have just described. It was the mark of approval from the foreman, or Overseer, who had charge of a number of the craftsman. It is in a very real sense the rightful claim of the Mark degree that it preserves in several ways the operative traditions of the ancient craft. The presence of the Overseers with their examinations, their plans and mark of approval, are all traces of that connection"". Brothers of the Mystic Tie, this book is well researched, easy to read, and will be of benefit to both American and British brethren of all Masonic experience.

A1F5ZAUCP4KDVG,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"Reid Emory needs to forget his traumatic past, get his moves back and get himself a girl. The new rising star of Hollywood seemed to have lost his game with the ladies, and he needs some help. Good thing, he can trust his PR to solve his entire dilemma from his love life, down to his career.

Jordan is a walking catastrophe, but shes good with her work. She can handle her clients just fine until Reid Emory walked into her life. He was making her crazy along with his family and friends. When a publicity stunt went wrong, she found herself along with Reid being pushed under the spotlight as his new love interest. Will their on-cam romance turn into off cam?

I had to admit, this isn't my favorite book in the series, but I still had fun reading the third book in the series. Its crazy as hell and you just cant help but laugh or smile. There are some parts that the humor is somehow overdone, making parts of it a little bit corny. Nevertheless, this won't hinder your enjoyment in reading this book.

I love both of them. Jordan isn't perfect. Shes a relatable character, a person you can practically tell yourself: Im just like her!!! Reid is, well, Reid. Not as crazy as his brother, but just equally charming. Im just happy he surpassed his traumatic past.

#NAME?,Yelp,"3.5 years and counting = ~$600 in membership dues paid, and it's worth it. Mostly for the tater tots, but I'd throw in the amaze-balls cocktails, as well.  I'll admit that my girl and I first joined this joint in hopes of finding cute, successful men to hang out with. So that part didn't really pan out but other things have...

Let me tell you a story about a drink. It's cold outside (the perfect weather for me to brave a strappy high heel over the sidewalk grates and snow), there is a hot drink on the menu that comes with a cookie (!), and a girl is thirsty. The order is placed for this cookie-drink and it is meticulously made by cooking things down on a little bunsen burner including molasses, multiple liquors, and coffee, then served with a biscotti. I have never stopped thinking about this magic and let B&S know exactly how I feel about it. They have promised to always have it during the cold months, after I emailed them to tell of my true feelings.

The food, to be honest, is hit and miss. It's always creative and always pretty good. Sometimes spectacular and sometimes falls flat. Like the chicken feet.  But the drinks and small plates are a pretty safe and delicious bet. I've even had a dessert fail, and sugar is my thing. So, stick with small plates if you want to play it safe. 

The chef did just recently change, and I admit there was a bit of fear on my end but the Instagram is loooooooking goooooood. On that note, their social media campaign had been failing recently, and even the restaurant looked a bit empty on weekend nights, but since the switch, both of these things seem to have improved.  I definitely appreciate all the cool photos I can click ""love"" on.  I've noticed a few less-than-stellar reviews since the switch over, so I will update this after an official visit if it's not up the the 5 stars.

As a last little note, there is valet parking but it's never necessary and I giggle at those that like to valet. Street parking is abound. I'm a pro-paralleler and like to show off/practice my skills, anyway. Watch out for the sidewalk grates in heels. Trust me.

Originally I installed them without an amplifier but they were connected to an aftermarket Kenwood head unit. The bass was flat and the high notes where to high. I tried adjusting the settings on the head unit until I gave up and decided to try an amplifier in hopes that it would increase the sound quality. I purchased the Pioneer GM-D9500F Class-FD 4-Channel Bridgeable Amplifier which provides 75 watts X 4 Channels at 4 ohms. With this connected I tried it again and the sound was louder but not any better and it seemed as though the speakers had trouble handling the amplifier. I finally had enough of listening to this poor sound so I tore into my door yesterday on my driver side and sure enough!!! The cone on the woofer has become detached on a portion of it and if the factory soldered terminals shift a certain way the woofer cuts out altogether.

I'm a sucker for second chance romances and I love it most when one doesn't make it easy on the other and boy does this one take the cake.  Not that you can blame her.  If you read Wilder you know a little of the backstory and what a playboy Nova has become.  He's wild and reckless and a true ladies man.  No attachments and no emotions, it's all just sex to him.  And this for a very good reason.  When he left Rachel behind he left a piece of his heart and his soul.  He's aimless jumping from bed to bed just looking for a fix but never for anything real.  His stunts and his team are what he puts his heart and soul in these days.  That is until Pax makes a bold move to land Rachel on their boat, and when he sees her again, he knows this time he will stop at nothing for another chance at love!

Rachel is a badass, there is no other way to put it.  Her snarky attitude and her cold shoulder toward Nova are a force to be reckoned with.  I loved her from the very start.  Once Rachel is finally aboard the ship, she realizes just what has been done.  But she cannot ruin it all for her best friend, so it's time she suck up her pride and make the best of it.  How hard could it be staying away from the man that destroyed her and left her standing with the keys to their new apartment and disappearing without a word.  I mean it's a big ship right??? Unfortunately it's not as easy as she hopes, and Rachel is quickly thrown into a tailspin again.  Walking that fine line between love and hate, after being destroyed by someone who promised you the world.

This book is so crazy good I don't know how to explain it.  The ups and downs of this one will gut you at times.  The stunts that the Renegades pull even more dangerous then the last.  I sat breathless at times over the words that Rebecca throws down on the pages.  She turned me into a pile of goo at times, and others had me on the edge of my seat in anticipation!  I can't even tell you how much I loved Nova and Rachel and their story.  It's one of the best books she's written to date and that's saying a lot because I loved her other series...

A35VOTH7LRWE2V,Amazon_Reviews/Electronics,"In spite of all the great reviews, I'm a little disappointed in these. I didn't expect much for under $20, but if you consider yourself even slightly more concerned with quality than the average user, I'd get something else. The one big problem I have is they don't fit my head! These are much more round-shaped, rather than oval-shaped. The result is that the top of the headband (which is hard plastic!) mashes down against the top of my head, while the sides protrude wayyy out from the side of my head. It seems like you have to be really really fat or just have a really round or wide head for these to fit properly. (I tried to show this in my pictures. I'm camera shy so hopefully those will show what I'm talking about).

Secondly, everyone is raving about how these block out background noise, but I can still hear my ceiling fan running when I have these on. Perhaps it's because of the fit, though. The audio quality isn't terrible, but its really not very great, either. There's little bass and little treble, and everything just sounds muffled and flat, even if you adjust the equalizer on your player. One final complaint, the cord seems heavier than it should be (again, I'm comparing these to my Skullcandy's).

Everyone is quick to bash on Skullcandy, but in my case at least, my $35 Skullcandy's are far superior to these $15 Sony's. I'd definitely recommend spending a little more and getting a set that's more comfortable with a narrower and preferably padded headband, with better sound quality, larger earphone cups, and a one-sided cable.",0,wayyy,way+,way,") mashes down against the top of my head, while the sides protrude wayyy out from the side of my head.","One final complaint, the cord seems heavier than it should be (again, I'm comparing these to my Skullcandy's).",0,0,"[')' 'mashes' 'down' 'against' 'the' 'top' 'of' 'my' 'head,' 'while' 'the'

My son gets rather impatient for the food so it was very beneficial to sit outside where my son thought we were taking a sight seeing a with all of the turtles and fish in the water. First we started off with hush puppies. They came out nice hot and fresh. Sooo tasty and I can definitely tell they were home made. We came on a Sunday morning. Kids eat free on Sunday and my son loves applesauce but usually ends up leaving the burgers half eaten. He told me he loved his burger and was actually eating it all so that was a plus. I ordered the 1.50$ margarita special and a side ceaser salad and 1/2 dozen oysters. I'm a big ceaser salad lover and I could tell they made that themselves as well.

I did a HDD test and the speeds are as advertised (500 MB/s).  You need SATA 6Gb/s in order to get advertised speeds.  I really think no laptop/desktop should ship with a traditional (spinning) HDD.  SSDs have a very significant performance boost.  I have a desktop with a traditional HDD and it is a PAIN to use.  Starting programs takes a looong time.

There are no CONs for this SSD, but I do have cons in general for all SSDs.

1.  Price/gigabyte is still high for SSDs compared to traditional HDDs.  I wanted to get at least 500GB for my laptop but the cost was high.
2.  SSDs are limited by the SATA ports, and I'm not aware of any newer version of SATA coming out.  So even though SSDs speeds keep increasing we'll be stuck at 500MB/s until manufacturers start ditching SATA or there is a new SATA version out.

A3L89C3OUZR4PU,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"Such a cool book. It's a mystery - that is not too freaky, which I loved! The only thing that took some getting used to, is how the book switches back and forth (ALL the time) between multiple characters POV from multiple time periods. It's quite fragmented - you get used to a character, then it's back to a different character 100 years later. It is well written besides that fact, and I love the overall story that fits together so well, once you read the whole book (which is 550ish pages - it's been a minute since I have read anything over 300-400 pages).
I thought I had several parts figured out and was pleasantly surprised to see I was wrong (I like books that can surprise me!). I was gasping in a few places with surprise towards the very end (meanwhile, my hubby is teasing me saying,""It's the Butler who did it, in the Drawing room, with the Candlestick.... LOL), and I was happy with how it all ended - it has good has closure. Def alot adversity in this book and some very creepy characters who are bad along with some ultra cool characters who are so good, but overall, it's the feel good book I was seeking after reading the Hunger Games series... LOVED this book. I will def have to re-read it again sometime. I highly recommend this book! :)

For spoliers, scroll below:

Okay, the character, Linus. Awk! He is SOOO creepy! Def in the top 5 of all time creepy characters for me. And it almost implies that he is Jack the Ripper.... which is so scary!

I make both of those statements with the utmost respect to this astonishing book. It was gritty, gutsy, grueling, heartbreaking, and filled with hope. All of these things and 2 boxes of tissues are laid at the feet of one Ms. Sarah Goodman. She took what could have been a touchy subject and made it sing. Why the word sing? Books like this take a skilled hand or else they become a mess and just are not ""real"". This books gave me a description of what I was going to face...and then this gutsy author delivered. Not only was this story filled with depth and raw emotion but she went to places that most authors would shy away from as being ""just too much"". Then while we are handed this story with intricate depth and emotion she starts handing out characters who are complete and fully realized. Not only that but there is the promise in her writing that these characters are sooo special to her that they will be having time in the sun with sequel upon sequel. This is a book of a lifetime for this author. I have read hundred of books and have done hundreds of reviews for Amazon but I would put this book in my top ten.

UMG4ZH7l3tMZRf6zLILyXQ,Yelp,"If I could give negative stars I would. STAY FAR AWAY from sears. Bought a Kenmore Pro refrigerator from sears in May of 2016. It stopped cooling and freezing fall 2017. Called home services, first service appointment the technician decided I was too late in his schedule so he wasn't going to show up that day (he called at 5pm to tell me this), he showed up the next day and found he needed to order parts. Parts were ordered (they had them shipped to my house without telling me the parts were being shipped to me), refrigerator wasn't repaired until JANUARY 2018 (yes, you read that right, we had no refrigerator during the holidays). The refrigerator had sat for so long moisture built up in the freezer causing the railings to rust so you had to push with all your might to close the freezer draw (filled a complaint with sears to have them replace the railings and it was denied because the technician lied and said he told me to keep the doors open or railings would rust )

Fast forward to now July 2018, the refrigerator and freezer is NOT COOLING AGAIN. Called sears to find the warranty on their shoddy work only lasts 90 days. Good thing I had the refrigerator placed on my homeowners insurance after the repair in January right? Nope, think again! The compressor and sealant system is still under manufacturer warranty so my insurance company will not repair it through their technicians. As long as the parts are under warranty, my insurance company requires sears to repair and they reimburse. Called sears and requested a same day appointment and to my surprise, I got one (or so I thought) between the hours of 1-5pm. 5:15 rolls around and there's no technician insight so I called sears only to find that the STRONG accented customer service rep (somewhere in India I am sure) mistakingly thought when I said I wanted an appointment for TODAY, I was saying I wanted an appointment for TUESDAY.

I couldn't understand why I would get dizzy, lightheaded, or even felt like any moment I was going to ""seize the day."" Matt tells me you drink too much and eat too little, and I quickly responded ""I don't want to get fat."" I am a very stubborn person and didn't listen.

So I did what any rational person would do, go Vegan!
Matt told me I needed a high calorie diet, with lots of salt, and to drink less. Did I listen?  No...  I lost a lot of weight, got sicker, colder, and I was about to be fired from my job. I was seeing bones in my body and I truly knew that I was going to have a seizure or I was going to die. I had no energy for anything. I couldn't move. Everyone told me this diet was healthy, so why do I feel like I am dying. I started collapsing in my apartment, and I knew it was time to give in and eat the FOOD. I gained 30lbs in a month and half, which to some is a lot, but put me back in normal body weight. Matt said I had done a lot of damage to my metabolism, and it would take a lot to fix it.

My faults with this place? Expensiveee.
I had a trainer that would constantly be on their cell or would walk away to talk to friends.
Train sessons 3 times a week here will cost you about 299.99 plus the monthly fee
The classes I liked were always at times I couldnt attend I wished they had more of a class selection between the hours of 3-5pm.

 the beginner spin class is great the teacher steve is awesome! Its definitely a shame the class was always empty on monday nights. He would adjust your bike to fit you and explains everything.  He is highly encouraging. My favorite class.

My least favorite was wednesday night zumba.
The teacher tries her best, but alot of the dances were off beat. there was also too much shimming/booty smacking. Good cardio but I never felt like my body was well worked out.

I reallllly wished they had kickboxing more often but I believe it was only held on the weekends.

Overall I would give them 2.5 stars

Also cancellation is pretty tough! Either you come in and talk to someone or you have to certify mail a notice of cancellation. Faxs or emails are no nos!

The relationship between Ryder and Andi is a bit cute, if not marred with some tensions and distractions. There is a significant arc to the story that may have had me a little.frustrated However, I think its a sign of a solid author, when just a few words can cause the reader to have to pause and think some strong words that cant be repeated!

Despite what the cover says it has NOT been updated since then and at least one of the hikes described was apparently done in 1978 - 29 years ago!!! The book is also notorious for giving the details of a youth hostel near Tokyo that actually closed more than 20 years ago. It also misnames a mountain - called ""Ontake-san"" in the book - which is actually the name of a different, much more famous and much larger mountain. Basically the kanji (Chinese characters) for the mountain's name can be read in two ways and the author got it wrong.  However the introductory section and the info on Japan's geology is interesting.

This was a good option in the 1980s but it isn't now and could well be dangerous - Japan's mountains have heavy precipitation, are prone to earthquakes and vulcanism and, in particular, are being badly affected by global warming so it is important to get CURRENT information before heading into the hills.

A forbidden romance forms between Kaz, the Bratva heir and Violet, the Mafia principessa. Instead of denying their attraction toward each other the both embrace it. Being who they are they have to be careful to keep their relationship a secret, but secrets have a way of being exposed.

It's so freaking good. I jumped for joy when these two authors announced their collaboration together. It was not a disappointment.

I'm gonna keep this short because all you need to know is:
1) Make reservations if you can (but not necessary)
2) Order Mr. B's BBQ shrimp - it comes in the shell (with the eyes + everything, which is so not my cup of tea but that's just how it's cooked. Don't let this deter you because the flavors of the dish are truly incredible).
3) The hot buttered pecan pie. A. la. mode.

A2830S3DRHQWAW,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"This is HANDS DOWN the best vegan cookbook out there. I plan to cook every recipe in the book a la Julie and Julia (have probably done 1/4 or 1/3 so far.) Each family member rates the recipe on a scale of 1 (inedible) to 10 (gourmet delight) and I date the ""event."" I also notate if I omitted or substituted an ingredient. Only ONE recipe has been below six, and that is some dessert bars that simply disintegrated. A caveat? I substituted honey when the recipe called for Karo syrup. That's yet another thing I like about this book; it's really savvy as far as nutritional value with almost zilch of fake food or bad-for-you ingredients (like...Karo syrup.)

If you like a touch of gourmet, lots of fresh, but don't want all the expensive fake meat- and dairy-like ingredients, this is YOUR book. Also, the pictures are gorgeous and realistic PLUS I have learned SO MUCH about cooking, like dunking veggies in ice water for X number of minutes. Being a Southern cook, I appreciate the aesthetics of this author and hope he does a follow-up.

I cannot imagine thinking this book is for the gourmet chef only. I rarely spend more than an hour on one of these delectable dishes. Only the Persian rice dish has been a major pain as far as labor intensive, but OH, was it good!!!! Definitely for a special occasion, but isn't that what food is about?

8020672,TripAdvisor,"The Magic Castle Hotel was all that it was built up to be on tripadvisor. Make a reservation here and enjoy your vacation.
The location in Hollywood is terrific. You can walk to the Hollywood and Highland Center, the Chinese Theatre, the Kodak Theatre, Hollywood Walk of Fame, etc. For this part of town, their price is more affordable than most and you get your money's worth in space. We reserved a one-bedroom suite and it included a living room with a pull-out sofa, a dining area, a full kitchen, patio with table and chairs, small bathroom and a separate bedroom with a king bed. One sign of their excellent customer service was that they had already placed a rollaway in the living room for my son before we arrived. The room had almost more closet space than my own house! The morning breakfast was adequate with offerings of delicious scones and assorted pastries, yogurt, fresh fruit, cereal and milk, juices and coffee. Our children enjoyed the heated swimming pool in the courtyard.
The room itself needed some updating. The telephones, furnishings (bed and dresser, sofa bed) and the bathroom were very outdated. The A/C in the bedroom also was not sufficient to cool the room. My in-laws had a studio room which was more updated than ours and they were quite pleased with my choice of hotels!
We loved this hotel and would stay here in a heartbeat if ever in LA again. Why? Because of the wonderful staff and excellent customer service! The staff were ALL very customer-friendly. ""Service with a smile"" must be their motto. When we checked in late on a Thursday evening, they offered us an orange soda spritzer in champagne glasses to welcome us to the Magic Castle Hotel. They gave us a menu of snacks (incl. sodas, bottled water, candy, and chips) available free any time of day (we took full advantage of these throughout our stay). They offered us popsicles as we lounged by the pool. They lent us free DVD's for viewing. They also printed out information on a world premiere happening on Hollywood Boulevard. By far, the nicest ""touch"" was the birthday cake and balloons they had for my mother-in-law in her room when we checked in on her birthday. 
Their covered parking is very secure and we took advantage of the added bonus of entrance to the Magic Castle for Saturday brunch. That is a ""must do"" as well!!!

Ah yes The food!   I had the smoked salmon with cream cheese, on fresh baked Texas toast sized sour dough bread, with scrambled eggs.  Yummers is all I can say.

Being from NY and a former stylist myself I'm very familiar with tiers , I asked for a top tier stylist, my hair is long and a dark brown true level 3/4 , told the girl my goal was to get a little lighter with hopes to get some form of balayage in the near future. Stylist barely said 2 words to me and put me in their private room in which I sat alone for almost 40 mins, not one person checked on me, no drink offered nothing, during my application the stylist walked away 3 times leaving me sitting there for what felt like forever each time. Finally time to wash and glaze I literally sat in the wash bowl with my head in the sink for 30 mins as she tossed on the glaze and disappeared again. At no point did ANYONE ask are you comfortable, are you doing ok? My freaking neck was killing me. Time to wash and some other person comes in and proceeds to tell me the stylist left ..WTH?? Who does that?
I left dripping wet got home to find not only was a not the same level I was, nor a touch lighter which I asked for I was a full shade darker my hair was shoe polish black dull and just gross. Horrible experience and I will never be back to this salon. Top tier stylist my ass

114948559,TripAdvisor,"I met some friends in Dallas and chose the Zaza. Ive been to the Zaza in Houston and loved it so picked Zaza dallas.
I stayed in the ""West Indies"" room. It was HUGE!!! Fabulous space, luxurious finishes, and the room quality that anyone who has stayed at the Zaza comes to expect. The suite came with a HUGE furnished balcony, overlooking the drive-in entry, pool, and Dallas skyline. Fabulous. 
Although the pool played loud music until late at night, the soundproof door on the balcony allowed me a restful sleep with not even one little peep of outside noise.
The hotel is trendy and beautiful. I am in my 20s and I find that it is a young, hip hotel. The Zaza may not be for senior citizens or ultra conservative people. 
Ive traveled all over the US and the space that you get for the price you pay at the Zaza is unbelievable. I stayed at a comparable hotel in San Francisco recently that cost me neary $1000. The Zaza was $300 and worth every penny.
Pros: 
I am not from Dallas but from what I saw, the surrounding area looked really nice. Lots of restauants nearby
Also, there is a convenience store right across the street, so you can save money by not using the minibar.
And free WiFi in the room!!!
Cons: 
Valet parking is for a fee, which is to be expected, but I found a spot on the street and avoided paying for parking!
The bathtub in the suite is not particularly luxurious (I dont know the name of the material-- maybe formica?). --That was the only thing that I can think that could be improved in the suite.

A2AYYCY8QWP27O,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"What a concept. Take all the known words in the English language, put them all in a book then describe what each word is, and then tell how to pronounce them! Who thought of such a concept? Apparently a person named Webster, that's who!
The book starts and ends appropriately enough with the words ""a"" (described as ""the first letter of the English alphabet) and zymurgy (which is the chemistry of fermentation). And between those two words you'll find descriptions of words whose meanings range from ""a vague notion"" to ""to shrink by a special process in manufacture"", and so forth.
Between ""a"" and zymurgy are fabulous descriptions of words that will amaze you every single time! Guaranteed!
You think your spell check made by Mr. Gates is up to this challenge? ""-pede"" isn't in the word spell check I have!!! How are we supposed to combine the form of foot or feet without it, Mr. Gates? It seems Mr. Gates mind is made of two many ""1's"" and ""0's"", and not enough centipedes!
Also included in this wondrous, unique book is a description of the abbreviations used in this dictionary (how else are you going to decipher ""Norw"" or ""m"" without it) and other wondrous subjects.
So if you need a word, and Mr. Gates neglected to place it in his word check, this book is highly recommended for you.

The restaurant was noticeably clean and glancing at all the ingredients you could tell they were all incredibly fresh.

They suggest some styles of pre-made bowls and burritos then they give you the option of building your own with an awesome check off sheet.

I created my own bowl:
White rice
Tuna and salmon
Cucumber, mango, masago
Spicy mayo and miso glaze 
Avocado, green onion, Kani salad and seaweed salad, sesame seeds and tempura crunchies

They give you a gigantic portion of everything you pick out and don't skimp on anything. I love that they make it right in front of you.

A12X1EQD5MEXLE,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"As a dog owner and scientist, I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  I believe that many can benefit from the information included by this author.  By going through the mechanics and function of the brain (most specifically a dog's) , I am better able to interpret my animals' behavior (good and not-good).  I found the discussion of the dog's senses intriguing and enlightening.  Furthermore, if during training you have ever wondered ""why am I not getting through... this is soooo simple"" or ""why isn't he/she getting this"", then I think that you will find an answer in the study of animal behavior.  I hope someday to breed and professionally train dogs, and so the information on puppys' physiological and social/psychological development will come in very useful.  If anything, I have learned how important early sensory stimulation on animals can be -- basically, how it can lead to a well-adjusted temperment.  However -- buyers note: this is NOT a how-to dog train in ""twelve easy steps"" or in ""5 days!""  That is OK... it is not meant to be.  I believe that dog owners and handlers should read such books as part of the overall training process.  In my opinion, the best obedience training involves both the dog AND human learning.

A2SEIDBSCWM4YA,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"This is a great book! I found it so hard to put down! It is a very enjoyable and quick read. I love the way Perrotta tells thestory through the eyes of five different characters -- Paul Warren (the popular jock), Tracky Flick (he overachiever), Mr. M. (the teacher and student governmnet advisor), Tammy Warren (Paul's sister), and Lisa Flanagan (Paul's girlfriend and Tammy's ex- bestfriend). This is a crazy cast of characters. THe twists and turns of the student government election and the surrounding events almost have a soap opera feel in that you get so wrapped up in the plot you just can't get away. But, at the same time you get to know the character really well. I think that Tom Perrotta is a wonderful author and i look forward to reading his other books. I have this book a rating of 4 stars because i think it is a great book -- one of my favorites -- but it doesn't have wonderful literary merit. Perrotta focuses alot on the plot and there is no real deeper meaning to the book, and it doens't leave you feeling changed in any way.

A8J49CW78V1M6,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"3.5 stars

Ahhh, this was a pretty solid debut novel, and a great start of a promising series! Forest of a Thousand Lanterns is an East Asian retelling of the Evil Queen's origin story before she became Snow White's stepmother, and it is everything I wanted it to be.

First of all, SHE DOESN'T BECOME EVIL BECAUSE OF A DUDE. I love my villains and I am a sucker for a good origin story, but my main pet peeve is when a female villain becomes evil because a guy wronged her. Sure, there's a guy in here, but there are so many factors contributing to Xifeng's embracing the darkness and it was really well done. Her descent was well developed and thought out.

Which may make my complaint seem a bit contradictory, but at times, this book felt really long. According to Goodreads, it's not even over 400 pages, but I honestly felt like I was reading a 500-page tome sometimes. There was so much information to suck up, and yes, this does result in quite a rich world-building, but... I think I would've been happier with less. It didn't read as smoothly.

I did really love the mythology and the stories everyone told. The characters were nicely fleshed out as well. I did guess some of the things that were coming, but the road was still an enjoyable one.

Overall, I'd really recommend this to fans of fantasy, villains, and retellings. You will find it very hard to resist Xifeng's lure.

Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for providing me with a copy",1,"Ahhh,","Ah+,","Ah,","3.5 stars  Ahhh, this was a pretty solid debut novel, and a great start of a promising series!","Which may make my complaint seem a bit contradictory, but at times, this book felt really long.",1,0,"['1990.'

I read Bennett's ""Mr. Shivers"" due to all the rave reviews it got, and found that book flat and very mediocre. However, due to consistent rave reviews of his other books I decided to give him another shot.  Never again.

First thing: There need to be warning labels on Kindle novels that announce: WARNING, THIS BOOK IS WRITTEN IN PRESENT TENSE IN AN ATTEMPT TO BE EDGY AND COOL.  I guarantee, 90% of people who read a book in the present tense translate all the passages into past tense as they read, so ... what is the purpose?

Second: This novel is waaaaaaay too long, with characters that chaotically bounce in and out of the story. The story ended but my Kindle kept telling my I was only 90% finished. Lots of wasted prose at the end.

Third: Plot is convoluted (I am being kind) and silly and ultimately dumb. Obviously Bennett was going for a Lovecraftian tale here, so he could check that particular genre of horror off his resume.

Rafe and Damon, had me crying, smiling and rooting for them. The dead villain was written so well, I wanted him to die a second death.

yq4FvdUb-IrQMNaPt2p63g,Yelp,"Epice is a small bistro by the same restaurateur as Kalamatas.  (I've also heard good things about Kalamatas.)  I'd never eaten Lebanese food before, but the menu looked interesting.

Parking is crazy in 12South, so before I drove out there I Googled to figure out the parking situation.  Epice has some spaces out front and a few in the Green Pea Salon lot. White's Mercantile lot is available after 6 p.m.  No problem!  I easily found a spot at White's.  Epice is definitely on the small side, but not in a bad way!  I liked the modern/simple decor (very zen), and our waiter was attentive and complimentary.  He didn't mind us taking our time through our courses and chatting away.

We ordered the Kibbeh appetizer, little seasoned ground sirloin bulgur wheat bundles with a dipping sauce.  I immediately said they were like mini Lebanese corn dogs, but in a good way!  Our meals included nice salads as well.  (Note: I don't like salad, but I made it through a couple of bites which is a big deal.)  We also ordered red wine to go with our meals.

For my main dish, I had the Hummos Beyrouti, a chickpea purée, braised ground sirloin, and pine nuts with pita chips.  It was really good!  Everything came out so fast.  After the appetizer I was only able to eat half of my meal, which pleased Dan immensely because he devoured my take-home box later.

We decided to indulge in desserts, so we share the Roz be-Haleeb (rice pudding with orange blossom infusion) and Katayef Lebanese crepes (one with a mild, sweet cheese and the other with walnuts).  The desserts were soooo good.  I would recommend it for a couple on a date, because it's quiet, intimate, and has good ambience.

Although she's still somewhat new to Crescent Cove and the surf life, she acts and is treated like most of the locals. I love that Haley isn't bitchy when things go wrong and that she doesn't judge people based on their appearance or background.

I went to pick up the order and was told to hold on.  I waited for awhile while servers went by and the sushi chef made rolls.

So, I pick up my order and when I get home realize they forgot one of my rolls.  When I called to tell them, rather than trying to fix the issue, Jackie said I never ordered what I ordered (even though she read it back to me exactly).  Again, rather than try to fix the issue, she tries to tell me I'm wrong.  Not only does she tell me I'm wrong, when I say I'll bring back the food that's wrong and refund my money, she says they don't give free food and she cannot refund my money for something I did not order...she as the manager, does not have authorization to refund money.

This place is a big beer hall with long wooden tables and benches. There's a long bar where you order the beer and then a separate place off to the side where you can order food - much of it Bavarian style. 

The beer selection was extensive and I'd love to go back and try more beers another time. I decided on two beers for this trip - the Cocoa CowTao which is a chocolate milk stout and the Chouteau Joe which is a coffee stout. Both were smooth and had really good flavors. They were both fairly low ABVs which is a nice change from some of the stronger stouts which I often enjoy. My husband and I also got curry wurst which came with fries and it was YUM! The other food looked really good as well. 

However, I saved the best part of last. You can bring your dog in here!!!

I was very skeptical buying this TV and was fully prepared to return it if needed given the many reviews regarding it turning itself on and off and freezing etc.  I was ""lucky"" (knock on wood) enough to find one under the used category in ""like new"" condition for $754.  It arrived in it's original packaging, which was in perfect condition.  The TV itself was packaged as originally from the factory as well as all the accessories,
When first setting up the television, the first thing I did was connect the wi-fi because I was hoping the newest firmware update would be detected.  While setting up the wi-fi the TV froze up and I had to unplug it.  Once reconnected and powered back on it immediately displayed a message letting me know a new firmware update was detected and I opted to download it.  It automatically downloaded and installed the update, which took about 15 minutes.  The TV has operated perfectly since then.

Example: Today I called to ask about some clicking noises that occur when on bluetooth connected to my Galaxy Note 4 but not when wire attached. The call went to a voicemail but I did not leave a message. About 20 minutes later I received a call from the company to see what support I may have called about. When I explained the issue I was told that it was excellent timing for the question since he was going to pick up the design engineer in a few minutes and would call back as soon as the engineer was available to speak with me. The return call with the engineer was made from a cell phone in a car and I explained the issue with the Note 4 on bluetooth connection. He immediately asked that I look into the most recent phone updates as a potential remedy since this was a known issue with new phones that are to be updated for bug fixes or operating system updates. I did find that a new update to Android 5.0 was now available from AT&T and proceeded to do the update. Sure enough this solved the problem!

A2F01IBM1CKKPM,Amazon_Reviews/Electronics,"""USED LIKE NEW"" the button below the thumb joystick was broken. The appearance from the outside looks like its perfectly fine. but the problem ive noticed (i have bought over 5 of these) is there is a small nub of plastic that presses the button on the board (inside). that nub of plastic EASILY breaks from normal use. Judging from the condition of the G13 I recieved, the previous owner sparingly, if at all, used the G13.. and still managed to break that button. This hopefully will be fixed if Logitech ever decides to make a new version.

I have remedied the problem by cutting up some plastic around the button inside, taking a small non insulated wire terminal (cut up also), and bending it to replace the POS plastic nub inside. if they only made this button more durable or even partially aluminum, the G13 would be soooo good.

A28XVMV7TEZPQQ,Amazon_Reviews/Electronics,"This monitor blew my mind away. I went from using a regular DVI monitor 23in to this 27in gaming monitor. What difference it made! It was a little difficult to adjust the settings to get it perfect but along with the graphic card's settings it came out like I wanted to. The monitor came nicely packaged. Wasn't hard at all to put together. I love that the power plug for the monitor doesn't have the big block in the middle. That being said it may be shorter than what other people are used to but it was still long enough to reach the power outlet. Perfect length for me at this time. The screen size makes me wonder why I never got a big screen to begin with. Now, I have a gaming tower that I built myself. In no way does it have this years best graphics card, motherboard, ram etc. I am still running windows 7 but it can run FF14 on high settings. Only issues when I had was in big raid groups or during ""fates"" that there was some lag on my screen. I just assumed it might have been my computer that just couldn't keep up with it. With this monitor all that lag went away!!! I did not realize that monitors can create game lag. All lag disappeared with this monitor. Everything runs smoothly no matter what I am doing on FF14. Very happy with this monitor!!!! I haven't played League Of Legends just yet but I have spectated some games and they look amazing as well. No lag from what I have seen. People who have seen the monitor say how much different the game looks in a good way. Also the cd did not come with confusing instructions on how to download the drivers for the monitor like I have experienced with others, especially the AOC Brand of monitors. This monitor doesn't have the speakers like the HS model but I have an awesome system anyways so no loss there. The HDMI cable was a little bit difficult to install since you really gotta get under there with a flashlight in hand but it was no biggie. The cable fit snug and didn't have any issues. You get all 3 types of connections on the monitor but only comes with a DVI cable in the box. Overall very pleased with the product and overall experience with Amazon, UPS, and BenQ,",1,away!!!,away!+,away!,With this monitor all that lag went away!!!,I love that the power plug for the monitor doesn't have the big block in the middle.,1,1,['With' 'this' 'monitor' 'all' 'that' 'lag' 'went' 'away!!!'],[2 2 2 2 1 3 3 5],1,1,0,5.0,8,17,408

If they did half of what they are supposed to they would be the best thing ever to happen in this category. First and most importantly the bluetooth is pathetic.  You can get 20 ft away most times.  Put your phone anywhere next to your body and it just doesn't work. I am on the latest firmware too.  Then there is the battery life issues.  If you get three hours it's amazing.  there is no way to shut them down if they are not in the case.  Even when in the case I'm not sure they shut off.  The touch sensors vacillate between not working and way too over sensitive. You really can't workout with these due to the horrific bluetooth TX and RCVR in these.  The app is so poor that it never keeps it's settings.  You supposedly can set your measurements from metric to standard.  Every time it resets itself and it can't store anything.  The max volume on these is a joke also.
I tried swimming with these several times and of course they either fall out or quit working during a swim. When they would stay in the sound quality was decent.  Really wish I could make them work in the water or even on a run.
Now let's talk about the phone use.  Don't even attempt this either.  When trying to use them for the phone they either won't connect or won't stay connected.  Then the controls don't ever allow you to answer a call.  You will find yourself yelling at no one while thinking you might have been lucky and connected.  NO!!! That won't happen either.

For example, when I went to a Web page and had some numbered hyperlinks (you know: 1. Sign in, 2.

I called a couple of times before hand to get an honest opinion on the status of the hotel. They were honest and informed me that they were at the end of remodeling, and that all of the rooms weren't complete. 
When I arrived there, Friday, May 26 I was amazed at how modern and sophisticated the hotel lobby was. The doormen were nice and helpful, and the front desk clerk had great personalities, and informative. I almost fainted from joy when I entered my room. The king size bed was extremely comfortable, there was 2 trash cans, there was a tv, and the place was clean. I do have to say that my favorite part of the hotel room was the bathroom. It looked 20 times better than a lot of chained hotel bathrooms that I've stayed in or visited. Marble galore, the shower was magnificant to point I can tell you, I would have to show you. Every detail in the bathroom was on point. 2 thumbs up to the decorator of the hotel rooms. 
The location was perfect: 20-30 min walk to the lake (perfect), 15 min walk to Marshall Field's, across the street from the huge chicago library, 20 min walk to the museum where the King Tut exhibit is displayed, 10-15 walk to millenium park. Need I go on....

I requested for one of the 2 rooms that I booked to have 2 beds as we were traveling with our 2 teenage sons. I also requested quiet rooms that were on the same floor. When we arrived, the woman at the front desk said that the hotel was unable to accommodate my requests for one room with 2 beds nor that our rooms be on the same floor. We ended up with 2 king bed rooms- one on 4th floor and one on the 11th floor. She was not very friendly and responded to my disappointment with "".

I can't believe that they couldn't accommodate any of my requests for any portion of our 6 night stay even after I called the week before!!!

If the service wasn't bad enough, the rooms also were disappointing and definately not 4 star quality. The shower not only had moldy grout, it also did not drain properly. While showering, you had to stand in 6 inches of dirty water. There was no blow dryer in our room and there was no coffee maker. There was no cabinet space in the bathroom - only a small pedestal sink with no where to put toiletries ( a real pain for a 6 night stay). Our soap was not replaced until I took more off of the cleaning cart myself.

40000059,TripAdvisor,"I booked the Chancellor hotel for its great location and actually it cannot be beaten!
It is right on Union Square which is the best place to stay in San Francisco for shopping, transport and sightseeing tours. No steep hills to get to this hotel!
The staff is great, at check-in we were given coupons, maps, small guide book, info, etc.
The room is small, but the walk-in-closet has plenty of room for 2 big suitcases. I was surprised at the attention to details of this hotel: the flat screen TV, the clean sheets, the soaps, the lollies, soft toilet paper!
I mean, nothing was missing! The view of Union square was great! And the room had sound proof windows so you couldn’t hear a thing from the street!
No air/con but I guess you don’t need it in San Francisco. When I was there it was veeery hot, but it was unusual for the city and the fan was ok anyway.
I have one complain about Luke restaurant which is inside the hotel. My partner and I had $25 credit so we had breakfast there. Omelette was good, but my fried eggs tasted like pancake! I think they cooked them in the same pan where they had just cooked a pancake! I had it changed but the potatoes (terrible they were…) had gone cold and the bacon too. The next day the special was steak…come on! You can’t have steak in the morning! I asked for pastry but they had none even if on the menu…..so the set was yogurt (in a bowl….) juice and white toast…all for $7.50 which I find expensive….I also ordered fruit aside as it was not included in the set…

6124340,TripAdvisor,"We stayed in this hotel for eight night towards the end of October. Our first problem was that we were supposed to be upgraded to a delux room and on check in this was not noted and did not happen. It had been agreed with the reservations manager prior to arrival. After travelling for almost twelve hours I didn't bother to insist. The guy who checked us in was terrible, scruffy appearance(he should buy a shirt that fits him!) and very abrupt. So after a poor start at what looked to be a fantastic place to stay we preceeded to our room on the 4th floor. Now our room was fantastic. Very roomy and very nicely decorated. 
One particular night we aksed the Consierge to recommend an Italian Restauart near by. What a huge mistake. We walked so far that we had to get a taxi back to the hotel to discover that the directions he had given us were wrong (wrong number and wrong ave). What a clown! It's a good job he was no where to be seen when we returned after walking what felt like the lenght of Madison ave on a very cold night. We advised the reservations manager of the inconvenience caused and she listen and nodded at the approriate times. 
On a lighter note when I requested ice / more towels / a newpaper they were all delevered to the room within minutes. Keep up the good work Housekeeping!
The location is fantastic and the hotel is very comfortable. The only thing we found annoying was the unprofessionalism of the stafff and the apartent lack of concern when a problem was raised. 
We were offerd a $100 off a meal in the restaurant in the hotel but we declined to accept it.

We immediately called the front desk and they had us wait in our room for the manager to come by - no one came by! We had to go down to the front desk and when we asked four different employees where are missing items were we were told ""I don't know."" This was more upsetting.

The food was so-so. Nothing wowed me and there was nothing I would order again. 

Boozy cupcakes ($7) - vanilla cake with praline sauce. It has a pipette with rum sticking out of the cupcake. This cupcake was so dry. All that sauce made it a dry super sweet cupcake.

Cornish hen ($18) - my friend ordered this. She said it tastes like very salty fried chicken. Dirty rice was OK. Creole slaw wasn't her cup of tea. 

Grilled veggie with skirt steak ($15) - I thought the dressing was overly sweet. Yes yes, molasses dressing. But, I just don't like my salad drowning in dressing. So. I got my steak medium rare and it was perfect and tender. Should have just gotten the skirt steak with fries and a side salad. 

Escargot St Michael ($10) - The blandest escargot I've ever had. But I'm prob just used to eating it smothered in butter. 

Service - David. He was really nice, but was running around the entire time servicing other tables. Apologized that the food was ""mediocre"" and said he hoped he would see us next time. Then the manager came to get us for the tour. Asked us how the food was. Asked us to be honest. I was honest. And he goes ""Well! I heard y'all wanted to go on a tour of the distillery."" Like. Obviously they don't gaf about their customers' opinions if they can blatantly dismiss it after asking for it. Like okay... why did you ask? 

Tour - wasn't their fault but it was terrible. We ended up being stuck with a group of 10 other women and a man. And they were face timing and snap chatting and really just disrupting the tour for me and my friend.

A3P1Y93VC0L87P,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"What a huge disappointment.  I started reading Patterson's books this year (2007) and have enjoyed them very much.  They've been simple and somewhat intriguing diversionary reading.  I like to read an author's complete catalog and I was looking forward to completing Patterson's.

Then I came across LONDON BRIDGES.  Yikes!  What was he smoking when he wrote this?  What a mess!  As I was reading, I kept wondering if whole chapters were missing.  The fault is not gratuitous sex or violence.  The sins were not those of commission, but those of omission.  He inserted characters and situations that went nowhere.  He raised questions he never answered.  (What WAS the mysterious connection between Tom Weir and the Wolf?  Why would a Wolf-imposter go through the agony of plastic surgery without anesthesia?  Why imply that the FBI mole was one female when it was really TWO males?  What did Al Queada have to do with the price of eggs in China?  Why blow up bridges, kill thousands of people, and not even consider the emotional fallout of those disasters?  Why would the Wolf allow himself to be seen by Cross while squeezing that silly little rubber ball?)  That's just the tip of the iceberg.  Had I inventoried and reported all the inconsistencies and ""blanks,""  this would be a VERY long review!

I am SOOOO glad I was to see Patterson at a higher level before picking up this paper-and-ink disaster!  Too bad he doesn't have a collaborator to blame for the nightmare of this book.

A1EDW2MY52QRJJ,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"This book is everything. I mean EVERYTHING! I encourage anyone and everyone to read. I stayed up all night to finish it, now I must take a quick nap and get on to reading the second book.

I'm emotionally wrecked!!! But in such a good way. It's heartbreaking and heartwarming. It's dark and it's light. It's smart, witty, loving, serious, funny, soulful, and so much more... and that's just the book in general. The characters...!!!!!!!

Hayden is perfect, just perfect. I've always seen reviews where people talk about 'book boyfriends' and I've never really been into that whole notion. BUT let me tell you if I ever claimed a book boyfriend, it would 100 percent be Hayden. He's so much more than the tatted up deviant that you see in the very beginning. He's deep, full of soul and love. And I just love him! Absolutely can't wait to read the second book so we get more of HIS story. 

Tenley... all I can say is WOAH. Without giving away spoilers, that girl has been through SOOO fxcking much and still continues on her journey. I mean there's no way I could go on like she has done. She's so brave and strong and doesn't even realize it.. which is why I'm reading that second book immediately! I can't wait to read how she continues her journey and becomes an even stronger person.

Their love is inspiring and I haven't even read their whole story!! I think the best thing is how Tenley continues to say she's sooo dependent on him but honestly they both can and have stood on their own for a long time. They are independent, they are each their own person BUT so much better together which I LOVE.

It is well written to impact you, to give you a mental picture what it is like during the 1st industrial revolution. This book will also endow you with an insight for what is happening in the second one and what is to be of coming. A good argument of the income spread which is enough to discredit a good deal of thesis done on income spread based on traditional thinking. This will not only impact your mindset, but it will also bring forth why some business leaders are investing heavily on certain businesses.

A1LN2WZ3VP4LP6,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"This book very clearly outlines the behaviors of a child with unmet needs. I see these behaviours now as alarms alerting me to look deeper to find the unmet need rather than judging it as ""bad"" or ""negative."" And the more i do this the intensity of the behavior is less as they trust i will be there and listen. When i had my first child the only information i was exposed to involved encouraging your child to be ""Independant"" by letting them cry alone in a crib ect. My heart was aching but it was all i knew. Then when exposed to the bliss of attachment parenting i went through an intense period of guilt. It was at this point i read Lauries book. I found it sooo helpful as she devotes a laege section of her book to repairing the damage and reparenting. Wow it was like music to my ears and i felt like i had a second chance. I used it and it truly worked. The information on the schooling system was alarming. As a homeschool family it serve to reaffirm our decision but for schooling families it is ""must know"" information. It is abook i wish evey parent was given as soon as they conceive.

NO ash trays! and a view of crappy birck walls!! and we were made to pay for a cot for one of us to sleep on!! and it gets better!! the next afternoon when it was 97 degrees out we got stuck in there elevators for a hour!! which was not nice at all!! BUT they wanted to make it up to us so they upgraded our room to a suite on the Fifth floor ! with a beautiful view!! BUT!!!!! we were woken up 3 nights in a row at about 11:30 at night to be told that they were having complaints of the smoke !! it was NUTS!! and then to make matters worse!! when we left!! we had a $87.00 phone bill because we were charged $1.00 for all collect calls after we were told that there was only a $1.25 charge for local calls!! and there was no charge fro collect!! pretty smart aren't they!!! so to say the least we wont be staying there again!! but as for our trip in general it was great except the HOTEL!! 
for the money a person spends on a hotel in N.Y you shouldnt have to go through all that!! the only thing about that hotel that was good , was that the doormen were great and friendly!! so decide
wisely when you pick a hotel!!

When we arrived, the desk clerk had no record of our reservation, which was made several months ago. I had brought a printout of the reservation confirmation and when I produced this,
she said ""Oh, we aren't a Clarion anymore - this was made before it was sold"". (PS - the Clarion logo was still all over the place in the lobby). And this is my problem WHY????????? Because Clarion, a member of the Choice Hotel group, took their whole reservation system with them when the hotel was sold, so the new owners had no way of contacting those who held reservations. The clerk said it was no problem - they would give me the same room at the same price - I should certainly hope so! I asked what they would have done if they had been full and she said they would have ""tried"" to find us someplace else.
This was our last night in Texas - we were returning our rental car first thing in the morning and wanted to stay along JFK Boulevard close to the airport. We did not need this aggravation. And here's the best part - Clarion actually sent us a reminder of our confirmation
a week before we left home - which was LONG after they had sold this property. What they should have been doing is informing us that the property had been sold and booking us in to another of their properties in the area. This tells us that someone at Choice Hotels is not crossing the t's and dotting the i's, and for this reason,
we will never take another chance again with any of the Choice Hotel line. Our vacation time is too precious to waste it sorting out a hotel's mistakes.

The lobby is upscale and modern. 
I reserved a city-view king deluxe room and I was very impressed. The desk was long and faced the window, the t.v. was a flat screen with a swivel base, and the bathroom was the icing on the cake. I spent weeks trying to decide between the Intercontinental Boston and the Boston Park Plaza and the Intercontinental won based mostly on the bathroom. I get so tired of tiny hotel bathrooms but this bathroom was one I didn't rush to leave. I immediately took a quick hot shower and then a long soak and it felt soooo good. There is a sliding panel window to the bath behind the bed. I liked it because you can see the room or t.v. from the bath. I think the window may become a factor only when rooming with others but since I traveled alone, I thought the window was pretty sweet. I also like sitting on the chaise lounge at the foot of the bed. The only downside is that the desk chair is more like a dining chair than an office chair because it didn't have wheels. I'm a gliding slider when using my laptop in hotel rooms so I didn't like having a wheel-less chair to sit in for 4 and a half days. My room faced the fire station and either they didn't receive any calls during the night or I must have slept like a log because I was never disturbed.

The hotel reservations staff was very accomodating of our request to get our rooms close together. Upon arrival at the hotel, the front desk staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. They were great at giving us information and directions for attractions in the area. Every employee we encountered was friendly and always asked if they could help or get us anything. 
Our room was spacious and very comfortable. The pool is one of the best things about this hotel. We spent a day just hanging out and relaxing at our hotel because we enjoyed the pool so much. 
The most impressive thing occured after we left the hotel. Our teenage daughter ended up losing her ipod. It had fallen out of her purse in the room as we were leaving. We called the hotel and explained the situation and they went up to the room and located it.. called me back on my cell phone (we were in the process of driving home with a very upset teenage girl) and said they would mail it back to us. We ended up calling the hotel with our corporate FedEx account number and we had the ipod the next day. 
The customer service at this hotel is fantastic - from the housekeeping personnel all the way up to the hotel management staff (who actually came up and introduced themselves to us and asked if there was anything we needed.)

Here is the run down:
~The location is fine for catching the 1 train and taxi’s into the “hotter” parts of the city. It’s off the beaten path which is fine, less crowds. With this in mind-in my opinion, it’s a great place for professionals, older couples and specialty stays. Clearly, anyone can stay and you’ll be glad you did!
~The left elevator was under repair but this wasn’t an issue for us. The other elevators were fine (about 5 minutes extra added to travel) and there are stairs! Plus you can only do so much about mechanical failures, ya know what I mean!
~The rooms were very clean as well as the linens. People call me a germ-a-phobe, so yeah, if I’m saying it’s clean…IT’S CLEAN. I loved this! After a long day in The City…it was a great relaxer! Again, off the beaten path so it’s not loud or crowded.
~We did in room dining and the food was decent too. Have the truffle fries & the sautéed spinach. It’s pretty good for late night hotel food.
~Lastly, I’d like to comment on the customer service. It was 5+ Star! These folks know how to do it; the smiles, the cookies, the printing of subway maps, the directions and more…just superb!!

Hotel is located on the 7th ave with 55st in the heart of Manhattan, few block away from Times Square and Central Park (5-10min walking).
Hotel: 
our room was on the highest floor 27th, number 2742 with the view on Central Park which was really nice. Room was big with balcony, bathroom very clean and comfy bed, Tv, iron, iron desk, hairdryer..i.e 
Only one minus was that there is no fridge in the room which is very needed during the summer when is so hot there.
There are 3 lifts and there is no problem at all to get one..especially when we were on the 27th floor..we never had problem with it.
There is internet cafe, gift shop(they give u all advice about New York u need), restaurant and cafe.
U can get safe for free at the reception desk which is very handy cos u dont need to carry ur passports and money with u all the time.
Service is perfect, staff - very nice people, u can leave ur baggage at the hotel if u have flight late afternoon and they keep it in the second floor in the special room.
Few tips:
We used every day for breakfast Fluffy's Cafe is on the 7th ave one block away, very good prices and lovely food and nice people there and for the dinner different restaurants (there are 100s) but the best one was John's Pizza on the number 260 44th st for pepperoni we paid 15 and it was small one but very big...its New York we talking about so meal portions are huge there..lol
Last thing its very good to buy 2days plus 1free tour bus for 86dollars from citysights NY there is web http://www.citysightsny.com/ and u can save loads money. Its really good attraction. Go to the web and check it whats included.

Baring in mind we went during Thanksgiving, and nowhere else had spaces, we were worried by some of the reviews we had read.
But with an excellent location, superb lobby and bars, average rooms and decent bathrooms, we felt we got what we paid for. 
Our room was small (I am 6ft 4"" so most rooms are small but the Mrs agreed it was tiny!) but what do you expect when you go to central Manhattan. If you want a large room you have got to pay for it - simple! 
There was nowhere to put our case, the room was that small, you could literally walk around the bed and that was it. But it was stylishly furnished and the bed was soooo comfy after a day shopping. The air con unit was very noisy at night, and the only view we had was of the Marriot hotel across the block.
The bathroom was again very small but the shower was superb and the products were off high quality and replaced every day. 
We booked this hotel because there wasnt much else available, and because of its location. We knew we were literally only there to sleep and wash, but we were more than happy with it. 
Yes it is small, but it is trendy, cool and ideal if you intend on just using it as a base to explore NYC.
We had an amazing time so maybe we ignored the bad bits of the hotel, but generally I would say that as long as you dont pay too much, this hotel is ideal for tourists who want to be close to everything.

Make no mistake, this is an old-style, bare bones hotel with no extra amenities. No AC, a creaky, slow old elevator, and very sloooow front desk sevice. However management has made the best of what it has, and the room I had smelled of fresh paint and the bathroom was newly redone, with immaculately white grout, new tiles and fixtures, and an effort to give a sense of a nice stay with decent toiletries.
There is no AC, but a large ceiling fan that did its job on a spring evening. The front desk is usually manned by one, maybe two people who do not like to multi-task. Many Europeans seem to stay here, and the language barrier, as well as the ridiculous amount of paperwork upon check-in, as well as an antiquated computer system and the use of old fashioned metal keys leads to a lengthy wait should you be in line. Check in and check out take over 15 minutes-- There is decent free coffee in the lobby 24 hours a day, which is a nice touch. 
The beds have a lot to be desired, and the pillows are synthetic and flat. Only two pillows on a queen bed instead of four, and a cheap, thin cover with no extra blanket in the closet. On the plus side, there is a large safe in the closet to hold laptops and large personal items, and when you leave your room you can use the deadbolt lock in addition to the handle lock. Also, the hotel locks the front door between the hours of 10pm and 6am to keep non-guests out, and guests can enter with a key. The front desk always had someone there at late and early hours, for added security.
The location cannot be beat. Turn in any direction from the front door and Union Square is all around you with its many restaurants and shops. The gate to Chinatown is right there as well. Close to the financial district too.
There are many boutique hotels in SF, and you never quite know what you are getting yourself into, especially in the lower price ranges. With the Baldwin, it pretty much meets average expectations, with no negative surprises, and even a few positive ones, like how clean it is, good security, and the overall feeling that at least an effort is being made to make the best of what they have. The neighborhood is great and vibrant, and again, with Union Square, some of it can turn shady fast. Not so with this location.

27302922,TripAdvisor,"Second stay here, this time two nights, enjoying the flat screen television, cozy duvets on the beds and the four pillows to luxuriate in. The lure of Earth Hour brought us back this particular weekend. The renovation is almost complete and the lobby area looks fabulous. Unfortunately, the new restaurant was opening the day after my stay, but we enjoyed the great breakfast via room service one morning and the temporary location the next. Just as in my previous review, the restaurant staff is amazing. Everyone is so pleasant, helpful and genuinely happy to be working in their hotel. 
Dined in Cityscape Friday night and fell completely in love with Tony Miu's Zentini, a wicked combination of Skyy Citrus, Zen Green Tea Liqueur and lime juice, followed by an equally wicked Grand Pandaro Cheese Pasta, all while watching the beautiful night skyline along the river.
Earlier in the day we had watched the Chicago Police boats going back and forth past Wolf Point and the river tour boats have already started service. Wish it had been warmer so we could have enjoyed some outdoor activity too.
This trip we got to the gym and were very impressed with the equipment available. Everything was spotlessly clean to begin with and there were wipes and sprays available to clean the equipment before and after use, which gives great peace of mind. There's stacks of fresh clean towels and a convenient spot to drop the soiled towels, so everything stays invitingly clean, unlike many gyms.There is also a very nice sauna in the same area, but we hadn't thought to bring swimwear this trip, so no pool - no sauna. Next time for certain!
Cityscape was a verrrry popular spot for Earth Hour so alas, we thought we'd have a better view from our room. We settled in front of the expanse of windows and watched as the lights went off in many downtown landmarks. It was gratifying to see how many people became involved in the energy saving movement, including, of course, the hotel who even doused the parking lot lighting.

The hotel does not offer individual room temperature controls... while there is a thermostat in your room it's tied to the main heating and cooling system (very hot - can't cool the room).

So based on all the great reviews of this hotel i selected this one...huge mistake..I am soooo angry and disappointed at this garbage hotel...it is literally the worst place i've ever stayed and i've stayed in some inexpensive hotels before...terrible is an overstatement
The room is sooo small our suitcases barely fit, and we had a corner room that i heard was supposedly larger (shocked) the other rooms must have been sooooo tiny....we were not given the crib we were promised but didnt ask for it because it honestly could not have fit if we did get it. 
The bathroom was so small we had to take the TPaper off the roll or it would get stuck on your leg as you tried to pull some of it. 
No iron
No Microwave
No Coffee pot, no basics, i mean cmon, Phone shortcut buttons did not work, had to call the front desk at their outside line to get through
No answer at front desk after 11pm!!!! 
the heat was sooo high when we got there, we walked in to the room and couldnt breathe, no one answered to help us adjust it down from the 84 freakin degrees it was set to so we suffered all night until my husband finally got it to cool down. 
Room service doesnt even open until 1130 and then there's only breakfast on weekends, My son couldnt get anything to eat there, nothing on the menu was even slightly kid friendly
When we did order something it took 40 minutes to come, so i didnt get to eat my lunch as my break was ending and the food came and was gross!! 1 sandwich and 1 burger cost $46 and neither were good at all. The fries were good thats it. All this and the people who work there have the audacity to be rude to the guests. If i was paying for this with my money i'd have left and stayed somewhere else or demanded my money refunded. ALL this and i've only been here one night so far and have 2 more to go and i'm already this frustrated. so what does that tell you? 
They clearly charge the ridiculous rate they do (250+ / night) simply because they are in a great location and they feel like thats enough to charge a lot and then they dont even have to give the simple basics that even a cheap motel offers its guests.

You can tell by how great every staffperson does their job that it is not by accident, it all starts at the top.
The room was well-appointed and spacious. The roll-in shower (I am in a wheelchair) was clean and safe and the rooms are very quiet. We worried that outside noise would be bothersome (the hotel is across from Tuft's University Hospital's ER entrance) but it was very quiet!

For the past 10 years, I've come to Boston to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day and have stayed at various locations... when I found this one last year, I can't imagine staying anywhere else. The location is super easy to get to off 90 and they have valet parking. Last year we did self park (there is a Marriott across the street that offers garaged parking) but this year we did the valet mostly because we were staying longer and had more luggage - didn't want to have to drag it across the busy intersection. I think the valet parking cost an extra $5 or $10... not too bad. Upon parking the vehicle, the doorman came out to greet us immediately and escorted us in while offering to help with our bags. Check in took all of three minutes and they were able to accommodate our request for a room on a high floor (6th floor our of 7, pretty good). 
There are two elevators... one is tiny with a narrow doorway. There is another one that is a little further past the tiny one that doesn't seem to be used a lot - this one is good when hauling bags! The common hallways are very wide and beautifully decorated but the rooms are small. But I expect this with a boutique hotel. We had a room with two double beds (SUPER COMFY), a rather large closey, and a decent sized bathroom. In fact, the closet was so large, it makes you wonder why they didn't incorporate some of that space into the regular room. But again, its a boutique hotel so I think they are limited with the placement of the walls - the building is pretty old.
In the evening a housekeeper came to drop off a couple of (complimentary) water bottles. The room had a large Poland Spring bottle for sale at $5... Shaws next door was selling the saem size for $0.83. The complimentary bottles and the Shaws bottles were good enough for us!
Checking out was just as easy - the valet parking was added to the hotel bill. They tell you it may take 15-20 minutes to bring your car around but it seems to be much less for mine. I did notice my car was pretty filthy... it was raining the day we checked in and it looked like it was under something dripping dirty rain water. It rubbed right off when I touched it so it didn't concern me - I think when you're parking in a city garage things like this are to be expected.
The location just cannot be beat. There are T stations within walking distance and Boyleston and Newbury street are only a couple blocks away. Lots of shopping and pubs!

The lobby is still beautiful (exceptional flower arrangements) as well as the Palm Court which serves afternoon tea and has a harpist playing there most afternoons. We were also there on Saturday night when they had a small band & singer for those that cared to dance. Breakfast was quite expensive in the Drake Brothers but on Tuesday nights they have buy 1 steak get one for .01. A group of us went Tuesday night and had great steaks. The service at the hotel was excellent from the front desk to the doorman to the great concierges (my husband used them extensively to book several dinners for large parties, at the last minute). The hotel also offered complimentary limo service (book in advance) to area places as well as to the airports. The only downside that we saw was that the rooms could use a little freshening up. Our carpet was a little threadbare as was the furniture. The bed was wonderful and the bathrooms were clean (altho there was a little problem getting a consistent temperature in the shower, you could get scalded). While in Chicago we had some great meals, including Coq d'Or (piano music at night) and the Drake Brothers at the Drake. We also ate at Shaw's Crab House, the Saloon, Hugo's Frog, Fulton's on the River, Ballo ( a part of the Rosebud organization), Carnivale (wonderful latin food), Marigold (the best Indian food I have ever had), Tuscany (in little Italy), Heaven on 7 for cajun and the best meal we had was at Catch 35(my husband actually had dinner there 2 nights), great fish and on Sunday nights 1/2 priced wine on select bottles.

We upgraded to the Claw foot tub room and i can say we were looking forward to it for weeks, perhaps that added to the disappointment. When we arrived, jet lagged after a long flight on a Friday we were told that our room was above the lounge and we were likely to hear the live music downstairs for the next two nights. when we questionned why they did not say anything on their website a slight surly reply followed and they offered to move us in to another standard room. I had to cause quite a fuss which I really resent doing, that no, I would not be downgraded, as I had paid extra. Eventually we were given a Junior suite which if I had paid for I would say was very poor. To be fair I had not paid for it, but the room was very dated and not inkeeping. We then after two nights got our claw foot tub, but be warned, although were offered a room with a balcony we did not get one! Really upset us as the balcony's are great, so we were excited when they told us we would get one.
The tub leaked and despite asking them to fix it, they said they could not find anything wrong with it - hmmm my wet clothes would say otherwise. They did offer to move our room again but we only had one more night and the idea of packing up everything again was not worth it.

17474834,TripAdvisor,"I stayed at this hotel on business for 3 nights. First of all, the hotel did NOT tell me that there was going to be construction going on everywhere, and I booked FAR in advance. The first room we (my partner and I) went to on the 11th floor had a NON working air conditioner. When we asked to switch rooms, they said they would send an ""electrician"" instead. Two people come up to look at it, and came to the conclusion ""these kind of air conditioners just are not that powerful."" So, does that mean it's broken, or not??! In any case, we moved to another room on the 11th floor (highest floor). Big mistake. Becaues of construction, the restaurant was moved to the 11th floor, so no matter what time of day it was, the 11th floor smelled like food, and not in a good way. Parking is also $41/day. Yes, that's $41. Union station metro is ""near"" but it is a looong three blocks. There are no good restaurants near by, nor stores. It is not a fun place to stay if you're coming as a tourist. It's not good for business travelers either. The organization I was attending a conference for had n dinner event planned , and the hotel failed to tell us that another event was taking place in that same room the minute we were done. It is fine that they booked something after us, but a little notice would have been nice. People from the next event started showing up (around 10pm) before we were even finished. Another annoyance, there is NO bottled water in the rooms or the vending machines on the floors....so I guess you can call room service, but what a HASSLE just to get some water.",0,looong,lo+ng,long,"Union station metro is ""near"" but it is a looong three blocks.",The first room we (my partner and I) went to on the 11th floor had a NON working air conditioner.,0,0,"['Union' 'station' 'metro' 'is' '""near""' 'but' 'it' 'is' 'a' 'looong'

3693419,TripAdvisor,"Firstly ... why do people say this hotel is expensive? Simply look up the prices on the web .. say 400 a night. (And that's USD.) Now look up the prices of an actual expensive hotel such as the Ritz in Paris or the Barq in Dubai or any normal four seasons, say.
The M. at T.C. is -- simply -- cheap as far as luxury hotels go. It's a cheap hotel. And that's that.
Secondly .. alll of Dallas is kind of spread out and you only get to anywhere by car. So suitably, the M at TC is simply ""nowhere"" - like everything in Dallas! They have a lovely S-class to drive you around in if you need to go to say the 7-11 for nappies, or whatever.
Thirdly .. the decor is best described as ""SORT OF LIKE THE WHITE HOUSE."" If you've seen a movie or TV show showing the inside of the White House, it kind of looks like that! Sort of formal - classical - American. You know, extremely high quality, very thick dark blue carpets, endless shiny new marble in the bathrooms, etc.
Fourthly .. bizarrely (considering the lovely quality interiors) the exterior of the hotel is laughable .. it loosk exactly like one of those ultra-ultra-cheap apartment blocks thrown up in US cities, you know, with sort of sprayed-on stone chips over chicken wire .. exactly like the cheapest possible apartment bldg in the US!
Fifthly ... the service is extremely friendly, ""the best of American"" sort of thing ... real Men's Men who will talk to you about baseball and Ferraris and stuff, truly friendly, and truly openly helpful as really only generous Americans can be. They are completely used to dealing with world statesmen, etc. But I'm not sure the service is all that COMPETENT .. things seem to get fouled-up a bit, etc. ..?
Sixthly ... there is the terribly famous restaurant. Really I only ate there once so I can't comment expertly in the famous food. But it is SOO formal .. why?? I'm completely in favor of formal, but I just wonder why it is so formal? .. I don't know.
Seventhly ... I guess it is An Icon, so if you visit Dallas you should certainly try and stay. Really, if visiting Dallas you have to try it once, and that's about the size of it !

Almost all of the reviews are really negative, while a few others are quite positive. I was pretty excited to get to this hotel, simply because I wanted to judge it for myself. So, when I arrived I was not surprised that the lobby was nice and the staff was so-so (not terrible, but not overly friendly). I have to agree that the hallways were rather dingy(and kinda creepy) but not so bad that I feared for my safety or anything. My room was quite small, the bed was not very big, and I did not have a very nice view. My biggest issue in the room would have to be the thin walls. I could hear just about every word and every t.v coming from the rooms around me. That was just a little issue for me. However, there were not any rats, stray hairs, unusuall stains, or whatever else I was expecting. Granted it was not the cleanest room ever, but by no means was it ""filthy"" ( as I have read).
If anything the worst part is that the hotel is sooo crowded. Getting on an elevator takes foreverrr, I seriously considered taking the steps 14 floors up, cause it got to be ridiculous.
Overall, I would rate the hotel a C-. If you are looking for a pretty nice place for a longer stay, I would go somewhere else.

117141039,TripAdvisor,"We stayed here 4 nights. Myself, my son of 20, my daughter of 16 and my elderly mother of 77. 
Upom arrival, after a long flight from LOndon, we waited about 30 minutes to be seen by reception. The man at reception was very unhelpful and not very pleasant. He told us we had been given two double rooms, although we had asked for two twin rooms a the time of booking. I pointed out to him that this would be innappropriate as it could be some way looked upon as incestuous if my 20 yr old son was to share a bed with either his mother, gran or 16 yr old sister.
His attitude was one of he couldnt care less. In the end we had to pay a further $140 to get a different room.
On checkout we had the same unfriendly greeting.
On a positive note, i like the secuity you need to go through to get to the lifts and also the hotel is in a prime location to get around.
The hotel was clean, although one of the rooms was very small.

95724056,TripAdvisor,"The only reason to stay here is convenience to the airport… and even that can be a negative. The hotel knows - chances are since you’re here, you probably aren’t going anywhere, so they might as well get every dollar they can from you.
It's easy enough to get to from the airport terminals, but the feeling that you have never really left the airport is sort of odd. You walk from the secure-feeling airport, to the not-so-secure-feeling underground walkways leading to the hotel and public parking areas, and then come to the escalators leading straight up to the hotel check-in area… and there you are, in the hotel. There were several security people noticeably walking the front desk area, so that was reassuring, but it also means that the lobby area is not very welcoming. Only a few small tables and chairs off to one end near the deli/coffee bar, but otherwise nowhere to sit.
My room was small-ish, but adequate, with a comfy leather recliner and work desk. Bed was very comfortable, bathroom was tiny. The rooms must be soundproof to the outside, I did not hear one single airplane the whole time I was there – but I would have rather heard airplanes compared to the noise from the room next door. I heard my neighbor’s coughing, phone conversations and a late night party with a girl, complete with pounding music. Rooms are not soundproof to next door, or even scentproof, as there was some smoking of something going on in my neighbor’s party room.
In room wi-fi was a joke. I asked at check-in for the rates, and was given the option to “upgrade” to a theater package room for an extra $25 a day. (any free wi-fi in the public areas of the hotel? I asked – No.) I declined the upgrade, took my regular room and when I did log in to the hotel’s wi-fi page, I was offered options starting at the top $17.50 (yes $17.50) for 24 hours of the best wi-fi. Other options were offered at a dollar less per day, $16.50 for not quite so great, $15.50 for less, etc. Or, $8.50 per hour. I paid for the $17.50. So not worth it. Sooo slow, many pages timed out before they loaded, or I would get a pop-up “this wireless connection has limited or no connectivity”, so some pages would not load at all. Really? I paid $17.50 for this? It was useless.
$3.75 for a bottle of soda from the vending machine. In the little sandwich/coffee shop, 10 oz bottles of soda were $3.00. From the sandwich shop, I had a chicken Caesar salad for dinner one night, and a tuna panini for lunch the next day - and a turkey burger from the restaurant in room service, and the food was good for hotel food, and not much more expensive than any other comparable hotel food. Still.. the overpriced soda. Why?

I read the reviews on this site prior to booking and felt good doing so. However, I could not have been more disappointed in this property. We checked in late after a long trip. We unpacked, my wife took a shower and I realized how warm it was in the room. The thermostat was broken. I called the front desk and got disconnected two times. So I went down to the front desk. They first told me they would send engineering up however it was late and i didn't want to wait around forever for them so I requested a new room. I was told they were completely sold out. When I insisted, they miracuously found a new room for us. However, no one from the bell service was available to help move us because a large party was checking in. The new room was OK, however the door didn't close all the way and very few of the electrical sockets worked...but at least the AC was working. In the morning, I told the front desk about the issues with the new room and they said they would get engineering on it. When we returned at 5pm to shower before dinner, not only had engineering not been there but the room hadn't even been made up yet. 
I found the staff to be aloof, arrogant, not helpful and one gentleman very strange (boderline inappropriate).

20635759,TripAdvisor,"I was nervous about the Latham based on some reviews on this website, but my nervousness was replaced with relief when we entered the hotel!
The Latham is right in the heart of Georgetown, and excellent deals can be found on the internet. We paid less than $100 per night for a comfortably appointed room close to shopping, restaurants, bus lines, and the waterfront.
There were a few slight snags. Somehow, they checked us into the wrong room at first, which was smallish with one bed instead of the two I'd requested. We decided just to stick with it, but later that night, when we were told of the mix-up, we decided to switch into the room meant for us which was double the size with two beds. The room was hotter, but right next to the pool. 
The beds are reallllly comfortable, the decor is nice enough; only the bathroom area could use some updating. We saw a few unoffensive bugs, probably because of the heat and the proximity to the pool. We were impressed with the professionalism of the staff, the lovely lobby, and the location, and while the outdoor pool is tiny, it is a welcome extra on a 100 degree day.

115360878,TripAdvisor,"My son and I visited Hotel Adolphus this past weekend. We live right here in Arlington, but wanted to take a vacation close to home. We went to the ""Taste of Dallas"" and visited all the nearby museums. My son is 14 and I was not sure how he would like Hotel Adolphus because he is partial to more modern settings. But, HE LOVED IT! He cannot stop talking about how nice it was and wants to go back for Christmas :-).
We came during the time of the year when The French Room is closed for renovation. Next time we come, we MUST dine at The French Room! I peeked in, and it is BEAUTIFUL!
Our vacation itself was wonderful, except for three incidents that do not directly involve Hotel Adolphus, but I will mention them show the fine customer service at the hotel. One has to do with a driver of the courtesy car for the hotel - the drivers are NOT hotel employees, but are contracted through other companies. To make a long story short, the driver was rude and unprofessional. I reported it to hotel management and they were very good at making note of my concerns, investigating, and passing them on to the appropriate personnel. Another incident involved loud, drunken patrons next door growling like wild animals (literally) in the middle of the night. I reported them to the front desk and security was dispatched promptly; they quieted down. 
The hotel is beautiful and classy, the rooms were immaculate. Breakfast at The Bistro was wonderful (best French toast I ever had :-)). The hotel is near sooooooo many attractions. We will be back!

139585277,TripAdvisor,"The hotel is in an amazing spot for walking around and exploring the city. If you're not much of a walker, the Bart/Muni is right there too. I even discovered a little park with free concerts right behind the hotel one afternoon when I went out for lunch. Usually I don't like generic Marriotts, but I was totally blown away by the friendly staff and awesome location of this location! 
Speaking of which, the staff was great. I ended up chatting with several different bellhops(?) and front desk staff members (I was there for 5 days). They were all awesome and friendly. For example, at one point I poked my head outside to look for a shuttle bus to a wedding. The bellhop I talked to when just looking around remember who I was and came looking for me when the bus arrived. Customer service like that is a rarity!
Some notes: 
Do not, by any means, go to the Starbucks in the hotel. There are dozens of other coffee shops and restaurants sooooo close by. We went once out of desperation when we were in a rush and it was a terrible idea. It took forever and they still messed up our order (a coffee and an iced tea - nothing fancy). 
Why four stars instead of five? I think it is bonkers that they charge for WiFi - and like $16 or $17 for it at that. I'm already paying a fortune to stay at your hotel, just throw in the WiFi (they do have free WiFi and plenty of couches in the lobby though, which is plus). Secondly, our bathroom was filled with mold. An otherwise pristine clean hotel (complete with maids who write you thank you notes for tipping them!) was somewhat soured by the reminder that I was going to wake up with sinus infection at some point from all the mold I was exposed to. Thankfully, our windows opened, even on the 25th floor, so, even though it was bad, it wasn't as bad as it coudl have been. Third, the walls are paper thin. Whether this is a problem depends on your abilities as a sleeper and your neighbors' abilities to keep quiet. I was awoken one night by loud ""activities"" next door. I was tempted to knock on adjoining door and shout ""I can hear you"" several times.",1,sooooo,so+,so,There are dozens of other coffee shops and restaurants sooooo close by.,) was somewhat soured by the reminder that I was going to wake up with sinus infection at some point from all the mold I was exposed to.,1,0,"['There' 'are' 'dozens' 'of' 'other' 'coffee' 'shops' 'and' 'restaurants'

83147648,TripAdvisor,"After reading some of the other reviews on here before our trip, I was worried we picked the wrong hotel. However, we loved staying here! They had us booked in a waterfront suite in one of the bays, but after reading many reviews I asked if we could get a tower suite. They had no problem changing our rooms. We were on the 12th floor overlooking the marina and Seaworld. I would highly recommend getting an upper floor in the tower to avoid street and other noises from the marina. We also brought our daughter's sound machine to drown out noises we may have heard. We really didn't need it that high up, but she's used to it so it did help. Our bed was soooo comfortable! The pillows were plush and plentiful. 
We didn't rent a car and just used taxis which are plentiful outside the front desk. I believe the hotel charges $25 a night to park. It was $6 to Seaworld and $25 to the zoo. They offer free shuttle service to and from Mission Bay Beach which is less than a mile from the hotel. We went during the off-season which was great when visiting Seaworld and the zoo. It was also nice because the hotel was not crowded and loud and we still had nice weather. 
The concierge was extremely helpful and friendly. They recommended restaurants for us and knew the cab fare to each place we wanted to visit. 
We ate at Swim one night which is a bar/restaurant poolside and the food was fantastic. It was a little pricey ($14 for a burger) but the quality was wonderful. The fish tacos were excellent as well as the kids meals. Each morning we ate at Einstein Bros. Bagels and sat on the marina. The bagels and bagel sandwiches were very good and seemed to fill us up. 
We just loved sitting out on our balcony and looking out at the city. We enjoyed walking around the grounds of the hotel because they were absolutely beautiful. Our 3 year old thought she was on a safari! The pools were heated and very fun with the waterslides. They also didn't charge for towel service, maybe because it was in October and not many guests.
If you are traveling to San Diego, going during the off-season was great since they always have great weather. It's nice to avoid the crowds. The hotel did not offer the ferry service to and from Seaworld though after September. No fireworks at Seaworld either after September. Otherwise, everything else was great!

The check-in lady was really lovely and as we told her it was our 30th birthdays she upgraded us to a king suite for free ! They do ask for a $100 deposit for breakages but you get it back if no damage is done.
The room we were given was on the 14th floor and the view was of some offices but we weren't bothered as we weren't there for that ! The room that greeted us was very clean,
tastefully decorated and had two double beds ! One each ! The bed was soooo comfy and there was peace and quiet apart from the humming of traffic and honking of taxi horns- very NYC ! The bathroom had a decent shower/bath and they provide you with complimentary toiletries, fluffy white towels and a hair dryer ! 
There was cable tv and decent 37' plasma tv to watch it on. The only criticism is that there are no tea/coffee making facilities and you have to fill up a bucket of ice to keep your drinks cold - we used to buy a big carton of orange juice and stick it in the ice and that did us ! There are vending machines for fizzy drinks but I wouldn't waste the money.
You can get room service but it is expensive. The Madison Bar in the hotel serves a variety of alcohol, cocktails coffee etc. Be warned it is expensive but if you are splashing out - well worth it ! Cocktails are around $15 each! 
We would highly recommend this hotel - tip a yellow cab to JFK airport is $45 + tip and tolls - for the same money we got a limo ($55) to the airport from the hotel and it is the ultimate way to spend the last few hours in this glorious city - the position is excellent for times square, empire state, rockerfeller centre, broadway, central park and generally everywhere - I will be staying here again when I visit what I call a home from home",1,soooo,so+,so,The bed was soooo comfy and there was peace and quiet apart from the humming of traffic and honking of taxi horns- very NYC !,One each !,1,1,"['The' 'bed' 'was' 'soooo' 'comfy' 'and' 'there' 'was' 'peace' 'and'

He was also very helpful with other information. We arrived and were treated like royalty! Very helpful staff & friendly! The hotel is aged a little but the customer service makes up for it hands down!! The bed was very comfortable & the liens soft. Room was very clean. The only issue I had was that the massage therapist named Sarah tried to cheat me on my 90 min massage but Phillip not only adjusted the different between the 60 massage I received but also took off the amount of the tip that I gave her plus more!!! He was one of the best concierge's I have ever had the privilege to work with. Everyone really cared to listen to me and made me feel very important. So the only suggestion I would recommend is that if you get an in room massage which is pricey but sooooo worth it, is to make sure the therapist can come up shortly before your schedule time and reenforce the time amount with the therapist. Check the time before & after. If they cheat you then take it up with them at that time. Also don't pay them directly charge it to your room so if you do have an issue with them the hotel can address it.

5444749,TripAdvisor,"My wife and I booked our Hotel QT stay online from Sydney, months before, sight unseen. All we had to go was the reviews on Tripadvisor and the Hotel QT website. 
We were VERY impressed. 
1 - it's VERY cool. All the rooms are different, but very trendy and yes, the beds are the most comfortable hotel bed ever. The shower/bathroom/toilet all in the same room didn't bother us, but it might if you're not intimate with the person you're sharing with. We stayed in 2 rooms over 6 nights as we had to change after the first night - we were on the 8th floor right over the street and the noise from the Garbage trucks drove me mad (my wife says she didnt' hear them but they drilled into my head). The great news was that when I went downstairs to tell reception at 3am, they were really nice about it and moved us to a (larger) room at the back of the building the very next morning. This new room, on the 10th floor, was so quiet we overslept everyday!!! 
The room was cleaned everyday, regardless of what time we left the hotel, and the staff were always friendly.
BTW - we booked the Class B room, so I don't know what the cheaper ones are like.
2 - it's 15 seconds to Times Square.
There are also some great bars next door, and a deli 3 doors up. You have to buy your own mini bar supplies which you can do from reception. This is great if you feel like a beer at 3am, but it's very expensive. Go 3 doors up and grab a 6 pack for the same price as 2 beers at reception. 
3 - Breakfast is great and you can eat enough to keep you going. Cereal, Bagels, Fruit, Juice, Coffee, Croissants, Yoghurt etc. You can eat it there, or the guy serving was kind enough to give us a tray to take it back to our room. There's heaps of seating too, just don't get there too late or there's no good pastries left! Remember to tip the nice man!!
4 - The pool and bar look great, but with so much to do and see in Manhattan, we never got the chance to use it. Although on one night we were there I thought we had walked into a nightclub when we came back to the Hotel. 
All in all, we would reccomend this Hotel to anyone young, young at heart, or anyone that wants a grrovy stay in NYC.

Rooms are cleaned daily, they even changed the shower curtain everyday, which really wasn't needed, but shows just how much they clean!

I had booked a Queen Superior room and was given room 311. It was a very impressive walk from the lift to the room, things looked good before even entering the room. The bedroom was a very good size overlooking the entrance to the Irish Bar below.
There was a 42"" TV, a coffee maker but no milk or spoons, a mini bar and the queen size bed was very high off the floor with a little footstool to help some to get into the bed!!!!! The bathroom was more than adequate with a bathrobe. The flannels and towels were changed every day, even if not left on the floor or in the bath.
There have been some comments about the noise from diners eating outside the bar, I did not find this a problem or the traffic outside the hotel even leaving the window open. Apart from food bars in Union station there are very few restaurants close so had evening meals in the bar/restaurant below. The food was fine apart from the corn beef which was not so good and is not to be recommended. The breakfasts were good, as near to an English breakfast as you are going to get.

He used points from his Hilton membership, which could explain the excellent service we received. Unfortunately, I believe the reviews that cite unhelpful/rude service staff, only because there seems to be a lot of that in the Philadelphia area. The majority are sincerely helpful though. We received excellent service, from the champagne and strawberries that were waiting in our room to the fantastic breakfast buffet. We love the view of Broad Street - and yes, you will hear some street noise, but we are city folk and don't mind. We swam in the pool and the jaccuzzi, although the children that were there made it less than romantic. 
We have celebrated our anniversary there as well. The beds are sooooo comfortable! You just sink into them.

136743596,TripAdvisor,"We recently had our daughter's wedding here. Austin has great outdoor venues to choose from but my daughter had been to enough outdoor weddings to know that her's would be indoors. We had family coming in from NY and Indiana so we needed everything to be in one place. The ATT center was the perfect venue, ballroom and hotel in the same place, close to downtown Austin and brand new!!! The rooms were immaculate, state of the art, energy efficient and quiet. Unlike the huge mega hotels downtown the ATT center had a casual, homey feel to it with plenty of place to hang out with family. The eating venues are great and you are on the UT campus so there are tons of places to go and see! The Presidentail suite was amazing as was the interior parlor suite which consisted of a living room area with couch, eating table and a queen murphy bed in the wall with its own bathroom and connecting door to the next door King bedroom with another bath. We had this room and my parents used the King. Guests with children loved this room and even brought their own babysitters! You can get this room with or without the connecting King and the rate is great for both!
 The food served at the wedding received rave reviews from the guests!!! We had the Olive Oil poached tenderloin and it was cooked to perfection. You can order it at their restaurant and I'd highly recommend it!
 The convenience of leaving the ballroom and walking to your room across the atrium was so very convenient for those guests that chose to stay at the AT&T center. No one had to drive home. 
 I would stay here anytime we needed a room in Austin. Taxi to downtown was inexpensive and easy to get at the front door. Sports bar is a great gathering place. Small pool but very nice as is workout room!

The location is a very short walk away from Graceland. In addition, they have a shuttle service that will take you to Beale Street in Memphis. A Sun tour van will also pick you up and bring you right back to the hotel. This was very convenient since we flew in and did not have a car. Oh, I forgot to mention that the Heartbreak Hotel has a shuttle service that will pick you up and take you back to the airport for free. We got in at 8:30 a.m. but check-in time was 4:00 p.m. No problem. We just had our luggage stored in the hotel storage room and went downtown to Memphis and did some tours.

The ambience was wonderful, elegant yet charming.

121694854,TripAdvisor,"We chose this hotel because of the good reviews on Trip Advisor, as we have every hotel in the last few years. Again, the reviews were right on! When we do a little getaway weekend in DC we usually stay at a hotel on C Street right behind the Smithsonian. However, their prices were really high, parking fee really high, and not rated near as good as the Washington Plaza. The purpose of our visit was to bicycle in and around the DC area. When we have done this in the past, we usually just bike the Mt. Vernon Trail to Mt. Vernon and return. However, this time we took both mountain bikes and road bikes. We were very impressed with the advances DC has made with the biking lanes. We rode our road bikes north out of the city on Saturday and after a great run around the mall area on Sunday morning, rode our mountain bikes around Georgetown and over to the Mt. Vernon Trail, through Arlington, and back to DC. The hotel could not have been more centrally located for our purposes. We left the van in the garage the entire time (which, by the way is heated), and were able to access our bikes easily. The location of the hotel is fantastic!!! It is within walking distance of many restaurants, coffee shops, sandwich shops, and only a few blocks walking from all the tourist attractions. For some, the distance may be too far, but our feeling is when you visit a city like DC, you had better be prepared to walk. Our room rate was unbelieveable. We knew in advance to ask for a room away from street noise so didn't really care about a view (we were hardly ever in the room anyway). We were next to the elevator, however, and because we kept the heating unit on ""on,"" really didn't mind the noise from the elevator. I would recommend, however, that you ask for a room away from the elevator. We were very fortunate that we had no late night I've-had-too-much-too-drink-and-am-obnoxious people hanging out near the elevator. The only negative would have to be the heating system. It was an unusually warm day for December (got up to 50 degrees), and no matter what we did, we could not reduce the temp in the room below 71 degrees. That is very warm for sleeping. However, the next two days the temp outside returned to a little more seasonable temps, and the room cooled down. The room appearance was very European. Yes, it was small, but it had everything you would want. The bed pillows were too firm, but I asked for some softer pillows, and they were delivered within 5 minutes. I must say that if you are a little large, you may have had trouble entering the toilet/shower area, and actually sitting on the toilet. However, for our needs, it was wonderful. The staff was great, breakfast buffet was wonderful, and we could not have been more pleased.

My boyfriend and I stayed here for Labour Day Long weekend. We had a great time except for the not so great weather. Be sure to check the forecast. The hotel is situated in the financial district of Downtown Boston. I found the streets were pretty dead around the hotel both during the day and at night. I dont know if this was because it was a long weekend and being in the financial district, everything was closed... However, everything is pretty close by approx. 5-10 min walk. 
We checked in late, and were suprised to hear that they automatically upgraded our room to a suite. It was a large room with a well equipped bathroom and closet. Very clean and pleasant! 
We also had the pleasure of dining at the Cafe Fleuri for Breakfast, which was GREAT!. We had the buffet breakfast, which is a little expensive at $22USD a person but is well worth it if you enjoy and great selection. 
If you like higher end shopping, be sure to check out Newbury St. about 10-15 min walk.
If you want to try some authentic Boston cusine and some BOSTON CHOWDA, try Faneuil Hall Market Place which is close by to little Italy where you can get a cappucino at the oldest coffee shop Cafe Vittoria. 5-7 min from Faneuil Hall

I was travelling with three girl friends for a bit of retail therapy and although the Roosevelt was a bit pricier than what they had in mind, and that said, I thought the prices had gone very high this year, I praised the hotel for it's location, the rooms, the cleanliness, the atmosphere, the whole package, etc etc. The cleanliness and the location were the only two definites. The staff were extremely rude on arrival and gave us the card to a room which could well have been occupied as it was a mess and the TV was blaring, we didn't hang around to examine. When we went back to the reception desk, we were told the room was ready and that the receptionist had been there herself, now sorry, but what receptionist checks all the rooms are ready, HELLO ! She never apologized, then she grudingly gave us another room, which was smaller, that's the worst of that hotel, the room sizes can vary greatly as it is such an old building, in the past we were obviously lucky ! Then for an extra fee of $140 we upgraded to a deluxe, at this stage it was 21.30 local time and we were still on our time of + 5 hours and we were wrecked, but the woman on reception was just hostile. She didn't seem best pleased we booked through Hotels and she kept banging on about them, but the prices direct with the hotel were way dearer when we were booking.

seem so disinterested in their jobs in general. You would be waiting 15 minutes to get a drink to your table and they wouldn't serve you at the bar.

The suites were appointed with sleek, modern furniture and had a separate living area with flat screen which was great because our relatives had a portacrib in the bedroom and they could stay in the living room while the baby was sleeping.

We knew that we would be checking in late so we called to make sure that we would still be able to get the room that we had booked. Durning this phone call they never bothered to take our names or look up our reservation, just said ""no problem"" to the late check-in. At the time we didn't think anything of this.
When we arrrived they told us that a room with two beds was not available and would not be available for our entire three night stay. Mind you, I booked this room 4 months in advance. We were told that we would get a room with one king bed and a sofa. One of our children would have to sleep on the sofa (not a pull out) and the other would get a roll a way bed. When we explained that this was completeley unacceptable and asked what had happeded to our reservation for a room with two beds, they basically said, ""sorry, nothing we can do"". I was quite irate, because providing a bed for each of it's gets is a hotels most basic service and they were failing to do that.
The next morining I phoned the ""Perfect Stay Ambassador"" and she was very sympathetic and told me that we would get a new room that day. I made arrangements with her to have our luggage moved to the new room while we were out sightseeing. Upon returning later in the day to our new room (with 2 beds) our luggage was not there. We had to phone several different departments to track down our luggage and it was temporarily lost. It took them a very long time to locate it and bring it to the room.
There were other little complaints that I had about the hotel, that alone they would not have been a big deal, but after the disaster with the room assigment, the other problems just left me feeling more aggrevated. The sink in the bathroom was clogged, the thermostat in our rooom wasn't working and them maid never left enough towels for four peoople. We were constantly calling to get them brought up.
Also, since it was a holiday weekend the hotel was booked to full capacity. There were several groups of college students staying at this hotel and they were quite noisy in the middle of the night. The atruim design of the hotel makes this very bad for noise.

115778212,TripAdvisor,"Stayed here on the 6th floor, king suite for 4 days. My boss is a Marriott Rewards member and we get treated like royalty :) I was hesitant about the stay after reading these reviews, but I ended up being very impressed. Front desk staff is exceptional, there is an odd smell in the lobby. Not bad, but I just couldn't place it. The elevators were sloooow and sounded scary. Once up to the room, I was impressed. Large suite with couch, good-sized desk, 2 chairs. Mini-fridge, sink, etc. 
King size bed, flat screen TV, LARGE bathroom, and plenty of room on the sink to store all my toiletries. Maid service was OUTSTANDING. Every day I returned to a sparkling room, extra soap, lotion, etc. 
Free breakfast!! I just took a couple of muffins, fruit and juice to go. I saw eggs, sausage, cereal, muffins, Texas shaped waffles, fruit, milk, juices, etc. The first day I was leaving the dining area with my food on a plate, and the desk clerk said ""Let me get you a bag"". She went into the dining room and brought out a little tote that I missed to carry my cinnamon roll and muffin. That is exceptional service!! Then, she took my plate to toss for me. Will stay again when staying in South Austin.

Yes we were probably the oldest people in Chambers on the Saturday night, but WE had the best table reserved for us by the fabulous staff!!! And as we had been travelling for about 26 hours appreciated the attention from the staff. I am vegetarian and they responded with a seasonal main which was great and as we didn't have dessert and opted for cocktails, Chambers gave my partner a candle in a cocktail glass as we got to midnight and his 50th Birthday! A fantastic attention to detail!!!
The hotel is in the Tenderloin and I bet you have been reading reviews about how ""edgy"" the neighbourhood is. The reality is the whole of San Francisco is like that - not just the Tenderloin, there are street people but in reality they don't even speak let alone approach you.
I even went to the off licence across the street at about 2330 and it was completely fine.
The hotel is secure, very clean and the staff are great.
Buffet breakfast is good and you can either eat it by the pool or in your room.
This is a city hotel - there is some street noise but no more than anywhere else.
If you are looking for a great hotel, close to the main shopping district and central for other areas the Phoenix will NOT disappoint.

They were gracious and accomodating. For example, we were there late one night after a trip to the Mesquite Rodeo (like 11ish) and everyone was in the lobby with some left over food from a party and someone went to ask for coffee and the staff brewed an entire new pot for us. They didn't act like it was an imposition.
There are two swans in the lobby, and the staff doesn't freak if you get close to them. The lobby is so lovely and open with real trees and a fountain. Yet cozy at the same time. Always have cold lemon water set up for the guests.
The morning breakfasts are delicous -- better than most hotel's continental breakfasts (and the breakfasts are including in the hotel price). there were made-to-order omlets, waffles, fresh fruit, bagels, yogurt, etc etc.
Seriously, don't know why you would stay anywhere else when you can have all this for a reasonable price and have a very relaxing, stress-free and very Dallas experience (Galleria next door!! Right by the Dallas Tollway, access to everthing). Ample parking and you don't have to pay like the Marriott down the block.

115000459,TripAdvisor,"Union Square is a great location to use a home base for a stay in San Francisco! We asked for, and got, a high level room (25th floor, out of 36, not bad), and although it was a west looking view, it was very nice! The room itself was redone and very modern! A bit of a negative was how thin the walls seemed to be ... the people in the next room sounded like they were actually in our room ... not what you'd expect from a high-end hotel.
I was very impressed by the conceirge service! We hadn't been to San Francisco for many years and needed some direction with local restaurants and sights. Joanna Husk (Concierge and Member of Les Clefs d'Or USA Ltd.) was possibly the best conceirge I've ever dealt with. She took the time to understand what we were interested in and provided us with maps, site-seeing suggestions, and an extensive list of restaurants within walking distance ... then she gave us specific recommendations to meet our interests. It's this type of service that makes you want to come back to a hotel!
As far as location, it was ideal. Easy to walk just about anywhere, as long as you have the time and stamina, up and down the hills! We walked to Nob Hill, Telegraph Hill, Fisherman's Wharf, and Ghiradelli Square. A beautiful city!!
One of the great features of the hotel is Grandviews restaurant, on the 36th floor. I probably wouldn't recommend it for dinner, but what a great view for breakfast!!! Our room rate included breakfast for 2 each day (anything you want) ... all you have to pay for is the tip ... a good deal!
Parking is another issue, but I'd recommend passing on the valet parking (way overpriced!) and park at the garage on the opposite corner of Stockton and Sutter streets ... right across from the hotel. Although it wasn't cheep, it was very convenient and much less than valet. We spent a day over in Golden Gate Park, and then over to the Golden Gate Bridge (which are too far to walk) and it was great to have the car accessable.
I know it's still ""par for the course"" at high-end hotels, but why do they charge for internet service? I'd highly recommend that they make this a free service, just like they do at most lower level and business hotels!

From the staff opening the door to your vehicle, bell staff, concierge staff, front desk staff, and staff that was just standing around, all were more than friendly to welcome you to the hotel. While it's hard to fault this, it was a bit overwhelming and tiring. Then we stepped into the room and we could see the hotel focuses on service instead of room quality.
The carpet in the room was worn thru to the pad in several spots. Several dark blotches in other spots. It just gave an impression of uncleanliness not typically found in a four diamond hotel. No air was flowing in the west facing room which had its drapes open in the sun on a 80+ degree day. It was hot!!! It took 4 hours before the room cooled down. Old box-style TV, no flat screens here. Bathroom was clean, but wallpaper was peeling in a couple of spots. Too tired to go through a room change after a long day of travel, we stayed put.
There is a restaurant in the hotel that we didn't try, but the buffets looked pretty good, although expensive. The Starbucks is small and limited in it's offerings. Room service was very typical, mediocre overpriced food, but tolerable and convenient.
Obviously, the location next to Universal Studios Hollywood and CityWalk are a big reason to stay at the hotel. There is a hotel shuttle (I presume provided by Universal) which was nice, but they stopped service at 4:30PM. If you stay until Universal closes or spend an evening at CityWalk, I'm afraid you'll have to walk back and sidewalks are few.
This hotel may suit business travelers better, but I that's kinda strange considering it's location next to a family attraction.

SERVICE: As usual the staff was warm, friendly and welcoming. Always saying have a good day or have a good night or is everything ok... World class service!! We dealt with Preethi at the reception desk when we had problems with a room key and she gaves us quick service and some advice to make sure they dont deactivate.

VALET: this is our first time using valet service from a hotel, it was quick and efficient and the staff were very polite and helped us to load our bags on departure.
last but not least... the Kimpton tradition... 
WINE HOUR: this is like the best part of everything I like about the Kimpton... one hour of wine service red/white... best part you can have more than one glass!! :) I find this service gives you the feel that you are truly staying in a luxury hotel...
OTHER: Hotel is well located near train stations, boston common and few other places within walking distance (ie Aquarium abt 15-20 min walk).
Another great touch is that they have water dispensers in the lobby. It is flavored with real fruits and is delicious coming back from a warm day on the town...

I guess some would say it is a trendy, chic sort of hotel, but I and my two friends did NOT like it at all. To me it looked like and felt like a college dorm room. The beds were mattresses on a raised platform (about 6 inches off the ground). It had no nightstand, so I had to lay my glasses and cell phone on the floor by the bed. No other furniture is in the room except a formica like counter top that stretched from one side of the room to the other. Even though the room had two double beds, there was only one plastic chair (like the kind you buy from Walmart). The TV was practically on the floor also. The bathroom is also VERY uncomfortable, especially if you are not with your significant other. The shower is out in the middle of the room next to the beds. The shower has a window wall from ceiling to the floor. There is no bathroom countertop - only a small vessel sink and a small round mirror over the sink. The only thing I found that I liked was that the ""johnny"" room had an exhaust fan. We were there for a three day conference, and I was sooooo uncomfortable.

The hotel is within a short walking distance to Rockefeller Center, 5th ave., American Girl Store, Moma, and Central Park. There are two subway stations within a couple of blocks that can take you to everything you want to see. Directly across the street is Ess a Bagel! (best bagels in the city!) Bliss Spa is on Lexington! One block from the hotel!( My mother and I had the foot reflexology, it was fantastic!)
As far as service goes, Affinia 50 was excellent!!! The doormen were always friendly and helpful with which subway train to catch. When I say helpful I mean above and beyond, they mapped out our entire trip to the Museum of Natural History and the subway route to Brooklyn. (we walked the Brooklyn Bridge from the Brooklyn side to Manhattan, Amazing views!!) 
Guest Services were always aiming to please and a short call away. Anytime we needed more towels or pillows(the hotel has a pillow menu, the whole family tried a different pillow, Fun!) Everything was brought to the room very prompt. 
The club floor was great and the continental breakfast served their was very good.($14.95) We enjoyed going down to the club floor at night and watching the flat screens ,sipping wine and talking about our day!

When we saw the 2nd room on the 4th floor, this one was worse than the first!!! I really thought it was a joke! There was smell of tobacco, dirty foot print on the bathroom floor… As you can understand we became very upset, and they gave us another room on another floor, nothing changed, I guess nobody cares about sanitary conditions in this hotel.
We asked to see the manager, but she could not give us something better, she was rude with us and told us that if we want something better we have to go somewhere else…
Guess what we did?
Of course we found another hotel near Times Square, cheaper and just renovated! (I'm gonna write a comment on this hotel too, a good one!)

121868248,TripAdvisor,"I stay at a lot of hotel. I stay at a lot of hotels of all different kinds, everything from inexpensive motels to pricey high end chain hotels. But after a recent stay at the Staybridge Suites in Times Square, I have to say I have found the most comfortable hotel bed ever!! There are many reasons why I choose to stay here to begin with. First, my experience with the brand. Second, was the location. Lastly, was the very reasonable rate.
For the location, the hotel is right on 40th Ave, between 7th and 8th street. This is a very good location, especially if you're coming into town via bus, as the hotel is directly across from the Port Authority bus station. The hotel is also a half block from the 42nd St Subway station, and close to restaurants, shops, the heart of Times Square. Yes, there are a few adult bookstores on the street, but that is pretty much everywhere in Times Square. The hotel is also very close to Parsons, and the rest of the Garment District.
The rooms are typical NYC small, but that is expected. What makes this hotel great is that there is a real fridge, a diswasher, and a stovetop. We brought dinner into the room one night, and these features made it easy to store and re-heat leftovers. (A real moneysaver).
The bathroom was very clean, modern, and nice equipped. There is also a nice flat-screen TV and work desk. For business people, there are more power outlets in this hotel than I have ever seen, which is awesome!!! And lastly, as my review title states, this is the most comfortable hotel bed ever!! The bed was soft and firm, and comfy with a great blanket and pillows. A real homerun all around!!
Last, the hotel staff was very friendly. I was with my family, and every staff member said ""hello"" to my daughter, and everyone was just friendly with smiles, despite the fact the hotel was very busy. 
If I have any complaint, it would just be the free breakfast area was crazy packed (but again, this is expected this time of year). There was plenty of food, and the service was great, but there wasn't enough seating.

Our room consisted of two twin beds and a kitchenette stocked with all the essentials. The room was extremely clean and very spacious, especially for a New York hotel room. When we arrived we had a note welcoming us and cookies and cashews waiting for us, which was a very nice touch. And maybe one of the coolest things about the hotel is that they have empty water bottles on each floor and cold, filtered water for you to fill up on your way out (or way back in). It was perfect and we filled up our bottles a few times. 
Everyone at The Jewel very friendly and helpful. And if you want to go to the Top of the Rock, ask them for a coupon where you can receive $2 off of each ticket you purchase. (And by the way, Top of the Rock is totally worth it…awesome views!) We really enjoyed the location of the hotel, too. It’s soooo easy to go and see Matt and Al at the Today show. It’s kind of crazy to watch Today on TV, knowing they’re so close! It’s close to the subway, too, which was a big bonus for us.
We also ate at The Terrace Club, which is just a few doors down from The Jewel. You receive 20% off your check if you bill it to your room. We weren’t sure what to expect, but it was delicious. My friend had salmon that she said was cooked to perfection and I had a chicken Caesar salad that was very tasty. The calamari wasn’t the best we’d ever had, but it wasn’t horrible.

However, this hotel must have been missed by the quality control people at Marriott. The lobby and general areas are nice, so we figured it would be a standard hotel room. However, upon checking in, we found that our room was SO small. Barely room for 2 people and 2 beds. This is Boston, not NYC or Tokyo, so I was surprised at how small the rooms were. The bathroom was very small and outdated and did not have a bathtub, only a shower. The rooms appeared to be mostly clean but I did find a few hairs here and there. 
The most disappointing part of the room was the noise problem. We were in an adjoining room, and the door between the rooms appeared to be paper thin. We could hear the man next to us even when he was just speaking at normal level. He was up all night arguing with his partner on the phone, and every conversation we sat wide awake for - we know waaaay too much about this random's man love life and marital problems. We also were awakened at bar closing time due to large crowds and many sirens outside our windows. I honestly felt like we were in a bad movie staying at some dumpy motel. I couldn't believe that this room cost what it did and this is what it was. 
The location of the hotel is good and within walking distance of many other hotels. However, the price at this hotel was comparable to the Nine Zero hotel (actually the exact same) and we have stayed at the Nine Zero, and it is 1,000 times nicer.

The hotel has automated check in kiosks similar to those in airports. That worked very slick and we were through it and on our way in a couple of minutes. There are staff in the lobby and they will assist you with any issues, baggage, etc. Elevators take you to the 4th floor which is their ""Mission Control"" There are folks at the desk there to aid you and they are very helpful.
From the 4th floor you take elevators to the cabins which are very similar to cruise ship cabins. Really, they are completely adequate and very trendy. We liked the neat features like the powered, convertible bed, heated towel rack and ultra modern designs. When in NYC you don't spend much time in the room so this place is great for couples who don't need much space. Each floor has a ""galley"" on it where you can get tea/coffee/water/ice 24/7. There is a fridge and microwave and this room is a great touch. 
The morning breakfast area on the 4th floor was perfect. They had your typical muffins daily and pastries on a couple of days. Was very convenient to hit this for a quick bite and beverage before hitting the streets. We never ate at the restaurant but spoke to folks who were pleased with their experience. 
This hotel is ideally located in Manhattan for those that want to hit the streets, broadway and all that NYC offers. We went to two Broadway plays and they were quick 5 minute walks. The area is very safe and we could come and go at any time without issues on the surrounding streets. There is a large drugstore right across 10th ave and a short walk east on 42nd street takes you to numerous restaurants and a nice market where you could get anything day or night. It's only a five minute walk east to Times Square and the action packed core of Manhattan. There is great access to the subway, port authority bus terminal and the hop on/hop off bus tours so everything is in short walking distance.

There is no refrigerator, so you are stuck hauling ice from another floor to keep any beverage cold. 
The worst complaint is that we asked for a quiet room - HAH!

When we complained, we were offered an even noisier room (instead of a suite) near the entrance - no upgrade, no discount, no free night. In addition, the highway just below is very noisy; because this is primarily a BUSINESS hotel, the guests themselves don't seem to realize that other people might be on VACATION so when they come back to their rooms drunk or get up at 6am they think it is perfectly OK to yell at their friends; they have outdoor meetings with loudspeakers that can be heard all over the property; and there is a riding academy by the golf course that smells like guess what? Horses! 
The beds were HARD - this was the ""upgraded"" mattress, at a time most hotel chains are changing to pillow-tops. And the pillows were so squishy I couldn't find enough of them to prop me up so I could read. 
Don't count on getting to eat at the fancy restaurant - it is booked by private parties most weekends and some week nights and is closed Sunday and Monday. The Mexican restaurant is a big joke - $12 for two American-style tacos! They have a captive audience and take full advantage of it.

I then noticed a pamphlet describing how to protect your valuables in your car. I'm not familiar with the Memphis area, but this made me paranoid that my car was not safe in the lot. 
I get to my room which was very hot. Usually, when I enter a hotel room for the first time, the air is already on. Luckily there was no problems with the A/C. Unfortunately, there were problems with the exhaust vent in the bathroom. It didn't work and I called down to the front desk to ask them why it wasn't. Apparently, the front desk stated that the vent is always on. I'm not sure how that could be since the mirror would fog up completely from taking a warm shower.
SIDE NOTE: I stayed at another Holiday Inn Express a week before on the outskirts of Atlanta, GA. This was the reason why I choose Holiday Inn Express when we visited Memphis.
The following morning we went downstairs for our free continental breakfast. The first thing I noticed was that the food was not like the food they served in Georgia. There was no bacon, sausage, etc. I asked the server where all the meat was and he came right out and told me ""We do not server meat on the weekend, it's too expensive for the hotel.""

The staff would not listen when we told them that guest were trapped in their room and it took 45 minutes to get out of the hotel!The Firemen were the only ones who helped us at all.

124318360,TripAdvisor,"My husband, teenage son, and I had a spur of the moment long weekend trip to NYC. Of all the possible locations to stay while in the city, I think Morgans is situated very nicely. Yes, I did have to ask the taxi driver if that was really the hotel when we arrived in the rain as it is not marked outside - but it looks just like the pics you see on this site. The hotel is right down from Grand Central Station where you can catch the subway to anywhere you want to go (and my did we love that place - got some bread, cheese, and wine one day at the marketplace and took it back to the hotel in the 4th floor ""library"" common area. Worked perfect to relax before our broadway show). There are great bars and restaraunts very close. There are a lot of tourist hot spots located very close too. The rooms were great. We had a one bedroom suite and it worked perfectly. When we left for dinner, they came in and made up the couch in the living room with a mattress perfect for my son. Everyone was happy with separate rooms (and more importantly to him - seperate tv's!). The rooms are very modern in feel, the bed very comfy, and yes, the bathroom is small - but I've had so much worse. There was plenty of room for all our stuff and the shower was a good one! Very hip, swanky type atmosphere. The continental breakfast was ok, but in reality with all the food we continuously ate, starting with a huge breakfast probably isn't the smartest thing! There were coffees, juices, cereals (hot and cold), muffins, bagels, sweets, etc. Perfect for us to start the day. 
I have to say, the very best thing would have to be the staff. Very friendly, outgoing, accomodating, and helpful. They helped us with every question, directions, and gave excellent recommendations on eating places. The service above all can make or break any hotel experience for me and this was a great one!!!

14426520,TripAdvisor,"I stayed at Murray Hill Suites for 6 nights as a single occupant. Like other reviews I would agree that it is not the most modern of hotels but my room was extremely spacious, clean and comfortable. It had both a desk and dining table. Also a separate kitchenette which housed a stove, a ketttle, a sink and of course a range of crockery and cutlery. You have to ask housekeeping if you require a toaster and/ or microwave, which they will promptly supply. I found the kitchenette very useful for breakfast. 
Most of the staff were very helpful and polite. I woulld like to say a big hello to the cleaning lady on my floor (4th). I did not find the hotel noisy like some other reviews but like any hotel it depends on who the other guests are at the time of your stay. Certainly the street the hotel is on is quiet., unlike the noise that hotel residents on Times Square face.
Around the corner to the hotel are some lovely delis, a small supermarket and Murphys bar which does delicious meals. Various restaurants and bars are within walking distance.
The hotel is also situated in a very good location for tourists. It is in the residential district of Murray Hill but is within walking distance of Grand Central Station. You could see the Empire State building from my room. Also Times Square and Broadway are within walking distance, although those that are unable to walk far can easily get around by the extremely good bus system. 
Pick up the MTA Manhattan Bus Map. I travelled alll over Manhattan by bus using a weekly MTA card costing $25 for unlimited use. You can get these in any subway station. It is a great way to see everything especially if time is short. Taxis are also relatively cheap. 
I would recommed a Circle Line boat trip to take in the Statue of Liberty and to see Manattan from the river, a helcopter trip and also going to the top of the Rockefellar Centre, which gives a great perspective of the whole of Manhattan.

Meine Freundin und ich waren sehr zufrieden: das Hotel liegt sehr günstig, vllt 8 Gehminuten vom Union Square, und die Nachbarschaft macht einen guten Eindruck. Wir hatten ein Zimmer im 8. Stock und ich muss sagen: sooo langsam ist der Aufzug nun auch nicht. Im Hotel gibt es keinen Luxus, aber uns hat die Innenausstattung des Hotels sehr gefallen, auf jeder Etage hängen Spiegel etc.. es ist klein, aber fein und irgendwie kultig.
Das Badezimmer mussten wir uns teilen mit den andren Gästen auf dem Flur, doch wir haben fast nie jemanden gesehn und kamen auch so gut wie immer sofort ins Bad. Die Putzkraft macht ihren Job sehr gut: Das Bad war immer sauber, man musste sich auf keinen Fall ekeln (diesbezüglich hatte ich im Vorfeld die meisten Befürchtungen). Auch das Zimmer war immer schön nach unserer Rückkehr und das Bett an sich ist sehr bequem!!
Es gibt eigentlich nichts Negatives zu sagen.. ich müsste echt überlegen und mir fällt nur ein, dass in ein oder zwei Nächten der Heizkörper ein wenig seltsame Geräusche gemacht hatte.. aber das war jeweils nicht von langer Dauer.

I ended up booking the hotel through the 1800 reservation line. The operator was rather pushy to book the room at the first rate given to me (ie 179 and 280 respectively for my 2 night stay- after about 3 different rates and offers I was finally quoted 179 promo rate for each night. Compared to other hotels rates I was satisfied and booked it. I chose for the rate, hotel pickup for Old Town Trolley, and location to the Smithsonian Air Museum- a short 2 blocks walk away. Yes it is in the business district which does shut down early and can feel a bit deserted - but I was fine with that. CVS , smaller food businesses , quiznos, McDonald's and Starbucks are all a short walk right in the same block on C Street! I was aware of limited food options so no surprises for me. Less traffic down C and 6th, less pedestrians. It was actually quite nice! Yes the rooftop pool is on the small size and only 4 1/2 feet deep. Life guard was on duty supervising each time we went. Room was clean and a convenient size for 2 doubles- roll away bed fit fine. Refrigerator cold! AC cold!bathroom had a nice long vanity counter- plenty of towels! Did my homework and requested room away from the train side and Nicole accommodated us!! Court yard downstairs was a pleasant for being in a big city. Ordered take out wings from the Bistro and they rocked!! The little Deli prices were not that high at all!!! Doughnut 1.00 muffin 1.25.... All staff I greeted especially at the front desk and housekeeping , the bistro, pool, were friendly. I did not like the fact that it appeared the in room microwave was removed from atop the refridge and when we inquired were told it was 10 dollars to get a microwave brought to the room. Also did not like missing the Old Town Trolley shuttle pickup for our nighttime monument tour - paid 11.50 for 4 for a cab to Union Station. Realized the next day by happenstance that it picks up at hotel 6 st side and not at C as I would have expected.

The first thing the waiter or who ever was running the place is that you need to change into a suit and tie. WTF I am paying $400+ a night and you want me to change when we where the only people in the restraunt. So we changed and was served our food. $120 for a freaking meal that was not that great.

We booked through Priceline quite some time ago, and the initial booking was for the Affinia...which has since closed, and the hotel is now the MileNorth. We arrived on Friday early, and a room was not ready, but they offered to store our luggage and call us when a room was available. We got a call just a short time later, and returned to check in. Our room was the standard king...on the 16 th floor. The room layout is a little odd, but it was just fine for the two of us. The room has all the basic amenities..really nothing fancy or over the top. We noticed some burned out lights, and we told the front desk, and they were fixed promptly. We did have to call and ask for toilet paper, which was a little odd...like couldn't they have stocked us with that??? We went to the rooftop bar twice and it was really nice. The bartenders were very friendly..and the view is really great. Overall, we had a good experience.

3757219,TripAdvisor,"I arrived at the Crowne Plaza in San Antonio after a 20 hour charter bus ride with 42 other family members! We stayed for a total of five nights and not one time did any of our group members find reason to complain. Check-in was a breeze; every staff member was attentive from the time we arrived to the day we left; and the rooms were clean, nicely furnished and ooooohhh so comfortable! One very nice touch was the sachet that each guest had in their room – it held everything needed to wind down for a peaceful night’s rest. 
In all, almost 200 of my family members checked into the Crowne Plaza for a three day family reunion. We used just about every amenity the hotel had to offer. Most of us ate from the breakfast buffet in the mornings - it was delicious. The swimming pool was a favorite gathering place in the evenings. And we even held our reunion banquet on the property. Everything was absolutely wonderful. Great accommodations, great staff, great food! Wherever our next reunion is held, I hope the reunion committee chooses to stay at a Crowne Plaza!!",1,ooooohhh,o+h+,oh,"Check-in was a breeze; every staff member was attentive from the time we arrived to the day we left; and the rooms were clean, nicely furnished and ooooohhh so comfortable!",We used just about every amenity the hotel had to offer.,1,1,"['Check-in' 'was' 'a' 'breeze;' 'every' 'staff' 'member' 'was' 'attentive'

122308571,TripAdvisor,"Just got back from a week long trip to Manhattan and it was FABULOUS!!!! New York is the place to be to get in the ""Holiday Spirit"". All the streets, stores windows and even the tourist traps are decked out with beautiful Christmas trees, lights and menorahs. Absolutely gorgeous store windows dressed up in animated presentation make for an unbelievable experience. We stayed at the Marriott Fair field Inn & Suites off fifth ave.It was a very easy walk to the Empire State Building, Time Square, Lord and Taylor, Macy's, pretty much everything was in reach by either walking a few blocks or taking the Metro (hint: buy a weeks pass and just do it! The subway is way cleaner than on TV and all the locals are super friendly). The desk staff at the Fair field were always cheerful and very helpful. Ashley was all smiles- all the time and Daniel was so helpful with suggestions for food and fun. Based on the service , location and price I would normally rate this hotel excellent. However, one of the two elevators was broken our entire stay and caused really long waits from the 12th floor whenever coming or going. Another downfall was the breakfast. It was average at best, ended promptly at 9:30, even with a full booked hotel and always very crowded. In fact twice, my husband and I said forget it and went to the corner Au Bonn Pain for coffee and pastries and the rest of the time we ate in out room. Even with the little inconveniences, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to get-away to the big city for romance and fun. The rooms are small, but that is what is expected in Manhattan and cleanliness is way more important than size. This hotel is friendly, safe, convenient and clean.

123251738,TripAdvisor,"From the time we walked into the hotel until checking out, everyone EXCEPT the restaurant was great! The doorman, bellman, front desk receptionist... Outstanding! Came for our daughters 6th birthday and our first time in NY. We got the I love chocolate package. This is where I knew we would never eat here. No one greeted us so after standing for about 10 mins we go back up to the front desk and are told we seat ourselves. Maybe the waiter and hostess that walked by 3 or 4 times past us could have told us that. We finally seat ourselves and tell the hostess that we had the package, so she and the waiters assume thats all we wanted? No water, menu...nothing offered. My husband finally went to the bar to order... And that's when some waiter came by to offer help? I wanted them to at least brink a candle out to put in the mini cake but that would mean someone would come around to check on us. It must have been too busy with the 2 other guests seated at tables? Then to top it off, they actually tried to charge me? Then checking out, oh gosh, over 45 mins to wait for a bellman to help with our luggage? After calling down 3 times my husband decided to go find a cart himself. That was a little aggravating. Other than those 2 minor disappointments (well, the restaurant being a huge one because when we have stayed at other hotels, they have always acknowledged our daughters birthday and taken some part to participate in it).... We are staying here again for the Macy's Day Parade... I cannot wait! Hopefully the service at the restaurant will be better next time we are there, not for us, we refuse to eat there, but the other people who decided to go.

It is very well kept and is the cleanest hotel I have ever been to. I live about 2 hours away from Philadelphia and my husband and I visit often for sporting events and family functions. We always choose to stay at the Aloft because it is a great value and it close to all the major spots in the city. As a runner, I appreciate the fitness room at the Aloft. The machines are new and in good condition. There are several pieces of equipment, plenty of towels, and free water. This is a service many other hotels simply do not have. There is a snack bar (it is a little expensive) but it is great for midnight snacks. The parking lot is gated and safe. The indoor pool is very nice - I highly recommend taking a dip. There is also free internet access, a pool table with free pool, and a lounge area.The best part of this hotel is the rooms. The rooms are nicely decorated and the showers are absolutely amazing.
