AZTZQ049W5XZX,Amazon_Reviews/Electronics,"The HD video quality on this camera is superb, but that is probably the only thing going for it. Still images often turn out warped, and it has trouble taking pictures in either dim lighting or when it's bright outside. In other words the indoor pictures will often turn out blurry or the photos outside in bright sunlight look like the camera has been pointed directly into the sun. The battery life on the camera is average, but it's major drawback is the construction quality. The camera is very cheaply made and 'feels' very cheap when you hold it. It doesn't have anywhere near the durability of other manufacturer's cameras within the same price range. I treated my camera very well, yet it stopped working only after about 15 months. I turned it on one day, the lens extended out, something internally snapped, and the lens would no longer go back in. And then it wouldn't turn on altogether. I had never dropped nor damaged the camera, yet some internal mechanisms within the camera broke regardless from gentle and normal use. The camera is also a bit bulky when compared to similar makes. The camera also seems to have problems reading memory cards. Mine wouldn't distinguish between a 2GB memory card, or an 8GB memory card. If you put in a larger capacity memory card in order to record more video for example, the camera would only recognize the recording time as being that of a 2GB card instead. In other words it wouldn't record any more than the alloted time before it thought the memory card was full, which of course it wasn't. Finally, the battery will only charge when the camera is plugged into a USB port. The battery doesn't come with a separate charger. This can become a huge problem should you forget to plug your camera into the computer. Thus you'll likely need to order yourself an extra battery with a wall charger like I did so you can be sure the battery won't die while you're out and about. In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this camera. Unless someone is selling a new one for a huge discount, say 50% off, I would shop around for a non-Kodak digital camera instead......",0,instead......,instead...+,instead...,"Unless someone is selling a new one for a huge discount, say 50% off, I would shop around for a non-Kodak digital camera instead......","Mine wouldn't distinguish between a 2GB memory card, or an 8GB memory card.","['Unless' 'someone' 'is' 'selling' 'a' 'new' 'one' 'for' 'a' 'huge'

4eNDZwixYstGKCfZGhqk8g,Yelp,"I was very disappointed in the Pinellas Park location. I love this chain of restaurants, but this one is obviously new and its people need more training.  The service was beyond slow and two of our 5 orders were wrong. Keep in mind, it was 7:00 on a Monday night and the restaurant was not busy at all. We were seated right away, but then it was about 10 minutes before anyone came to wait on us.  Our waitress finally came and took our drink orders; by that time we were ready to order food, but she didn't offer and ran away to get our drinks before we could mention it.  Once we did order our meals, it again took a really long time to get our food. 
One member of our party ordered a salad  and requested it without pecans. Before our food came out, the waitress came and asked if there was a nut allergy because the kitchen put the pecans on the salad. She offered to remove the pecans or remake the salad to which we responded they were fine on the salad (by this time we were hungry and could pick the pecans off).  The salad came out with a few pecans, but most picked off.  
Another member ordered an entree with two sides, when it came out it only had one side. Our waitress asked what the other side was (coleslaw) and said she'd be right back with it. By the end of the meal, she never brought it...even though she checked on our table a couple times.  We then asked for a cookie monster instead, which she had to ask if she could do. She came back to check on us a couple more times, never telling up that it would take about 20 minutes to get the cookie monster because it is baked fresh. Again, we thought she forgot about us.  We finally just asked her to box it for us, which took another extended time period.  Overall we were at the restaurant for almost 2 hours....way to long for a simple dinner.  However, the majority of the food was good, except the salmon was a little overcooked and the rice undercooked.

Granted, the rooms are a little small, but what do you expect in New York City - none of the hotel rooms are very big. The rooms themselves though were completely kitted out, lovely double bed, flat screen TV, DVD player and iPod dock as well as safety deposit box and small fridge. If you are like us and you are in NY to see the sights and do a bit of shopping then you don't really spend that much time in the hotel - but when we did, I have to say it was a pleasure! The staff were very helpful and the breakfast included in the tariff was a lovely extra, though you do need to be up either early or late to get a table - it seemed to be busiest between 8-9am (though it is open til midday!).
The location...fantastic! right off Times Square, on W45th Street which itself has some really nice Irish pubs if you fancy a nice drink, they also do some really good food!

As with most highend restaurants there is a certain level of service expectations. The service was somewhere between horrible and mediocre. We honestly got better service from the girl at Starbucks for the 2$ cup of coffee than we did for the 300$ meal we ate here!
Steaks were both overcooked(ordered med rare came out med well),server was pretty much non-existent and wine service atrocious. However, I would like to give a shout out to Jeff the busboy working in another section. He has stellar guest service skills!!
In a nutshell, there are way too many awesome and much cheaper restaurants in New orleans!

We debated between getting a cinnamon roll or red velvet pancakes as a morning appetizer. You can see from the photo what we picked. It was incredible, you would know that if you have ever had anything from their bakery.  The fresh squeezed OJ had great taste and nice pulp. Both my wife and I went with a Benedict this morning. My wife with standard eggs Benedict, I had the pork Benny. Food came out quickly, they offered us hot sauce. Only issue for the meal was the home fries were crispy but that is a personal choice. The adult beverages look yummy but we weren't starting with the booze this morning. They have you check out at the counter so you have to walk past all the tasty treats.

A11NIRUSEP12OZ,Amazon_Reviews/Electronics,"This is perhaps the biggest ""trendy"" waste of time and money yet. I, like a lot of other sheep, went out and quickly spent about $650 on this thing. Then I was told by Apple,for an additional $150 I could get two years worth of technical support which I gladly gave up. What they did not tell me was that I would have to be on a complete LEARNING CURVE( which they did not even understand themselves!) to use this product. First, let me say, don't waste your money on any Apple technical support gimmicks. I had some valuable notes stored on my Ipad 2 to do a convention with about three days before this happened. I went to Apple technical support because my e-mail did not work on my Ipad 2. Then they instructed me on how to delete my notes and ""wake up my e-mail"". I said, ""won't I lose all my notes?"" She said ""No, one has nothing to do with the other"". My response was ""Are you sure? I really need these notes for my speaking engagement at the convention"". She said ""No way you'll lose anything. Trust me"". What she should have said is: ""I'm an Apple tech support person, who gets paid by the hour, and it's no skin off my nose if you lose your notes or not!"". And that's exactly what happened. As per her instruction....I lost all of them. I was devastated. I had to spend days,scrambling to recovering at lease some of my lost notes. I will never get back what I lost...ever. I didn't know that everything on an Ipad 2 had had to be backed up to a REAL COMPUTER(notice I said: REAL COMPUTER). I was never told this. Now, that there have been so many failures and complaints about this product I understand they've created a thing called ""cloud"", which does the same thing....backs up your files. You will do better to buy a smaller version of a laptop and don't fall for the nonsense,like I did, that this is a great buy.....because it's not.
Wondering if my e-mail was ever fixed? After spending six hours on the phone with Apple and completely losing my notes and going through the process to ""restart"" my e-mail 6 times..... guess what? It still doesn't work!!! If Apple tech support is the standard for which other companies should model themselves,then we have NO STANDARD.

We also ordered the cauliflower pizza and I was extremely excited for it only to be extremely disappointed. It was wayyyyyyy too salty none of us finished our first slice.

We also tried so many times to flag her down, calling out ""excuse me"" but she didnt give us the time of day. When I told her about the salty pizza she continued to ask if we wanted a box for it... Like OBVIOUSLY not. She gave us the check without taking the pizza off of it and when I asked her if she could take it off she very carelessly said, ""I already talked to the manager about it and she's going to come over."" Okay... Cool but why did you not tell us as you dropped the check off that you were doing anything to take care of it? Then when the manager came over she started telling us that there's Romano cheese on the pizza and that's why people tend to find it too salty and that ""next time if we ever want to try the pizza again"" (seriously?) that we should ask for less Romano. So if other people tend to have the same problem why weren't we warned when we ordered it that it may be too salty so maybe we want to go light on the Romano?

I am a 60 year old RN of 40 years whose sense of humor is already over the top to begin with. I absolutely love everything she has written that I have read so far. I think the only series I have yet to complete is The Random Acts of Crazy set.  But let me tell you,when Uncle Mike started to describe picking up one of the characters, I lost it!! I literally laughed sooo hard that I had to use my inhaler ( I am an asthmatic who is totally controlled with minimum meds!!) This billionaire series is one of the best things I have ever read.  I started out reading Harlequin Romances that my Scottish Aunt got me hooked on at the tender age of 12.  I have read soooo many novels. Julia Kent has this type of humor in her books that just gets me!! Like it is just rolling along and then BAM !! You are laughing hysterically and your 12 year old daughter is telling to be quiet because she can't sleep!!
I have spent a small fortune on all her Kindle books, but they are worth their weight in Gold, for sure. This novel was particularily crazy due to the wedding, etc!! I know just staring a Julia Jent novel, #1, I will love the story line, as I alrady have loved everyone so far, #2, I will laugh my ass off, and yes, I have had to use my inhaler for at least 3 of her books, I don't care!!, #3, She will leave me drooling for what is next!! I really do not care what the story line is about, I will read it and absolutely love it!!!
I do have to admit though, I am a little partial to the Complicated Series, I would love to see soem follow through with those 2 lovely characters!!

M_5Yjbn3qfFbv51facTS9Q,Yelp,"Appetizers:
The chargrilled oysters were moist and tasty. They were topped with garlic, butter and parmesan. 

Main course:  
The shrimp and grits are made with gouda cheese with a slight smoky flavor. The sauce has a white wine base. Scallions and red pepper atop the shrimp gives color to the plate.  This surpassed 2 other shrimp recipes at other restaurants.

The jambalaya was a bit dry, as mentioned in earlier reviews.

Desert-the best!!! If you like buttery praline flavors, these 2 hit the spot. The pecan pie is served warm a la mode. Delish.  And the bread pudding, served warm wirh of course a buttery, sweet sauce.  The bread pudding is absolutely wonderful.....gone within minutes.....devoured by the wlohole table.

Pros: open  early, closes late,
great desert, good for people watching

AJNJNA093JUW0,Amazon_Reviews/Electronics,"Seriously this bag is perfect.

I'm from a big family, we've had laptops and laptop bags around for the past... hmmm, 20 years or whenever they made the first one my dad had it, lol. Anyway my point is that we've tried and experienced many laptop bags. My dad always used those leather Targus bags, and when each of my sibling went off to college he'd do the same. But these bags would cost upwards of $150 depending on the size of your computer.

When I got my mac last year, I wanted a bag that I could securely carry around my laptop but wasn't bulky like many Targus bags. I'm a VERY picky shopper and I ALWAYS shop around, pass compare, read reviews, etc... and I chose this one.

A few of the things that were important to me:

1. size: will it fit my laptop and give me extra room for atleast 1 book, folder, and pens/pencils.
2. security: is it well-padded for my precious MacBook Pro- my computer cost me $2000 bucks, sooo I need to know it won't get hurt
3. style: im a fashion-conscious person and I wanted a bag that was sleek and that would fit the personality, coolness, and chicness of my mac.
4. comfort: can I comfortably carry it around, are the straps padded enough
5. durability: will this bag last and will it keep clean,

This bag offers all of the above, PLUS its gone down ALOT in price since I bought it... last year it was $40 bucks or higher, now you can get it as low as $20... that's a STEAL for this bag, freakin lucky bastards, lol :)

Okay, so cons: Not many to really name. I actually can't think of one.... okay, if you want a bag that holds ALOT of books in addition to your computer then this may not be for you... I used it for college, but I would sometimes have to carry the book, depending on how big it wasm in my hand and carry 2 1-inch binders in the bag.... that may be a stretch. Lets see....

The fit: you can fit a slim textbook and a 1-nch binder in easily. you could not fit a 3 inch binder, a 2 inch binder would fit with folders. you could fit an average textbook and folders in there with no problem.

If you want to be able to carry your computer and, lets say- 2 or so books for your two classes that you have back to back then I would say invest in the Belkin Sleeve, then just carry a tote.

AMWSYAA6529GG,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"This is David Elliot's debut novel and what an exciting, gory, suspenseful story it is!

Set in the present time, the story goes back and forth over 700 years of bloody history of the border clans.

David Elliot is an unhappy man, he is terrified of dying having achieved nothing he felt was worthwhile in his life. He decides to learn more about his family history and he and his daughter, son-in-law and grandson travel from Oxford to the England/Scotland border and stay in a local cottage.

At the same time a dark evil spirit, William de Soulis, has, over the centuries, been slowly gaining power and money with the help of a murderer, Andrea Dettori, and some evil dwarfs called 'Red Caps'. He has been trapped in the nearby haunted and brooding Hermitage Castle -- in the hope of coming back to earth to live again as a human and rule, he would sacrifice anything or anyone for the power and standing he thinks he is entitled to...........including the innocent Elliot family whose destiny is somehow wrapped up with Soulis's.

  ""Hermitage Castle sat brooding on the edge of what was once the 'Debatable Lands', a three mile wide and twelve mile long strip of rough moorland, a few miles to the north of Carlisle, which marked the disputed border area between Scotland and England. So politically sensitive was this area, that the mere building of this powerful defensive icon in the 13th century, gave Henry III an excuse to invade Scotland, claiming it had been built too close to the border.""

This is the age-old battle of good versus evil with a few twists and turns thrown in, and some of the writing is a little gory, especially the battle scenes.

The stories of the clan families warring with each other down the years I found interesting and I presumed there really is an Elliot Clan Chief as she has a quote on the back of the book, all of which I knew nothing about.

The chapter where we are introduced to the business partners of Andrea Dettori and of how they obtained their wealth went over my head and I found it quite boring, and I'm not sure if it added too much to the story.

However, I thought the overall storyline was very good, with just enough happening to keep me wanting to read on. I liked the Elliot family and I really got involved in their torment, and as a mother myself I could certainly identify with Kate's protection of her young son, which was quite moving.",1,to...........,to...+,to...,"He has been trapped in the nearby haunted and brooding Hermitage Castle -- in the hope of coming back to earth to live again as a human and rule, he would sacrifice anything or anyone for the power and standing he thinks he is entitled to...........","The stories of the clan families warring with each other down the years I found interesting and I presumed there really is an Elliot Clan Chief as she has a quote on the back of the book, all of which I knew nothing about.","['He' 'has' 'been' 'trapped' 'in' 'the' 'nearby' 'haunted' 'and'

123032218,TripAdvisor,"We stayed here for 2 nights after a cruise and it was way too short! We were in a corner suite on the 20th floor, which was fantastic. Loads of space, super comfortable bed, great views out toward Lexington Ave., the decor was beautiful - and did I mention the comfy bed? The decor and style of the hotel was definitely hipper than your standard Hyatt. Loved having the mini fridge, microwave and sink to put a few snacks in. The bathroom was good-sized, although they could do with some fluffier towels - they seemed to be pretty worn out for a hotel that is only a few months old! That was the only complaint for the room though; we loved it, which was good because the days we were there were absolutely freezing and venturing outside for long was not much of an option! 
Another bonus - we were arriving off a cruise and were seriously hoping for an early check-in and our room being ready around 10 am - and it was, which just got the stay off to the right start! It was great to be able to walk in, check in, and go back to sleep! 
the front desk/concierge were very friendly - the only thing I would ask for there is an actual doorman. It was difficult getting loads of luggage in and out, hailing a cab (although the front desk/concierge did go out to the corner one time to find a cab for us), etc. The things you expect from a NY doorman. Not a deal breaker by any means though. Never used the lounge, so can't comment there, although it was nice to know it was available.
The location was great, very near to the sights of NY or a short cab or subway ride away. Lots of food options around, near to shopping, not far from times Square, etc. - 2 days was simply not enough!!! We will have to make another trip, this time just for the city!

7569832,TripAdvisor,"I am writing this review from my closet size room that I paid $100 for. I am staying here while I go t a conference nearby. Checking was
no treat. No front desk cleark was rude. When I got to my room, it wasa joke. I honestly have seen bigger closets in houss. The room is less than 10 x 10. The bathroom is about 2 x 4, with a ""shower/tub"" the size of thimble. It is actually 1 x 2. The furniture was as old as the hotel it looked like. I stayed in room 1202. The walls were filthy, I was afraid to walk on the carpet barefoot, it was so filthy. 
Dinner was a joke. Myself and to people I came here with went to the hotel restaurant, because you really dont want to wlk on the streets here. It is pretty scary outside...ghetto hood......Dinner- Waiter told us to ""just sit anywhere"".. There was only 2 other tables with people at them while we were there. Service was horrible. He just dropped the menus on the table and said..""I'll be back""....This is ok if you are at a low price place I guess... But the Menu was not cheap... Pretty high priced meals I ordered the steak sandwich @ $16.00, The other 2 got the garden burger. It took over 45 mins for the food tocome out... Like I said....only 2 other tables were there...not like they were busy.
Never got a refill on my ice tea. Nor did he waiter ever stop by to ask about our meal.
When we wre done, he stopped by and asked,"" So, you gonna pay cash...
or what?"".... That sent me over the edge...I told him I would be talking to the front desk to pay my bill...
Went downstairs and the GM happened to be there... I told him what had happened and said, just take care of my dinner bill.....and stop by my room later so I can show you some concerns.... He never came by and I will see if my bill has a dinner charge when I check out...

Survived one night of dark, dingy room, rattling air conditioner unit and carefully walking the path between bed/closet and bed/bathroom. Glad I am not overweight or would not be able to get through narrow doorway to bathroom and same narrow door way to closet. 
Poorly designed room has bedside table only on one side - the other side has part of the mini-bar food/snacks on a tray that says ""careful - if you touch this we will start charging you"" - not helpful, so did a MacGuyver and took trash can liner out and turned trash can upside down to make a bedside spot for water, alarm, etc.
Bathroom is claustrophobic even by NY standards...no way two people could be in this bathroom at same time. Not all rooms come with a bathtub, so be sure to check before accepting room key.
The concierge wasn't much help at the Whatever Desk. Asked for a recommendation for a good hamburger close by and the best he could do was the outrageouly priced Smith & Wollensky's chop house.

I've always had great meals here, and whenever I thought about the top of my list, this kept popping up in my head. It's delicious and often surprises me with its interesting flavors.

Recently, I suggested this for a friend dinner and my experience completely solidified Oloroso's top billing on my Philly restaurant list. Everything I had was fantastic, but let me point out some standouts.

Squid ink rice, the perfect amount of squid ink taste, rice with a risotto like quality, and perfectly cooked fried calamari on top. 

Charred eggplant, sweet from the honey, interesting spices, a touch of bitter from the char, a flavor combination I feel like I've never had all with eggplant that soaks in all those flavors beautifully.

Coca de recapte: a flatbread with boquerones (anchovies). There's another boquerones dish on the menu, but this is the one to get! The saltiness of the anchovies pairs well with the sweetness of the roasted red peppers and the caramelized onions.

And last but certainly not least, the roasted half pig's head. We decided to splurge and try this. This dish is definitely not for the faint of heart. It's a bit gruesome: They literally bring you a pig's head, teeth and all! Then they carve it tableside, and you're left with juicy, delicious pork. The outside is the crispy pig skin, salty, crunchy, but also sweet from the caramelized gastrique and it's soooooo goodddd.

hxBA8In10mWScuMvDe5XdQ,Yelp,"3rd visit to Jones on Chestnut last night. We went with 2 other couples and we had excellent service and a solid traditional comfort meal as expected. 

We arrived for our 6:30pm reservation about 10 minutes early and had to wait about 20 minutes for our table. Restaurant has limited space to wait other than outside so it was a bit crowded. They seated us and then the GM immediately came over to us and apologized for the delay and had several appetizers brought to our table on the house. We hadn't complained and were not looking or expecting anything at all but what a customer service oriented professional response. Even if the food was mediocre ( which it wasn't as it was very good as usual) we all agreed the service by the GM as well as our waitress made it worthy of another return or two or 3 in the future....

Kudos to the organization and management. Small  and unexpected gesture but amazing how everyone one of us commented how unusual it is to see things handled so well. 

Turkey, brisket, salmon and traditional Matzo ball soup were all on point as well as a great drink and desert selection.

Nz3vRitWgMdfgFLQJjuXpQ,Yelp,"So based on the Star system this is a ""Meh, Ive experience better"" and that about sums it up. I just hate giving a place that opened pretty recently such a low star rating.....but so be it. 

We visited on a week night, I was leary....this is essentially a bar with food. Big Surprise, just like almost every other restaurant in East Nashville, the area of Nashville which seems to be more Dog friendly than family friendly.....moving on....

So, as I mentioned we were leary as we neared the door we could tell this was a bar. Thankfully due to the no smoking indoors law that didnt mean we couldnt bring our kids in, still didnt mean we were sure we should. 

The staff eased our minds a bit by welcoming us in. Our waitress had a bright smile and treated us as though we were visiting a family restaurant. She made us feel at home and that is where the most positive aspect of this review ends. 

The menu is extensive for a small bar/BBQ type place. I was impressed with the selection. I opted for the Beef Brisket with coleslaw and honestly dont remember the other side dish, it was that forgettable. 
My other half had the sausage with beans and fries which he thought he was substituting for the coleslaw, but we later discovered we were charged for , despite the waitress' affirmations we would not be. 
Our Daughter had the corn dog and fries (proved to be the best thing at the table). We also tried the Hush Puppies everyone was raving on about. 

The service was pretty quick, our waitress was friendly. Not as attentive as I would have liked, but she was nice and that counts. 

Hush puppies came, those were quite good. We were all impressed with the temp and taste. 

Food came. My Brisket was plated over corn cakes which looked great, but were cold and hard. I couldnt even eat them they were so hard. My coleslaw was good and the other side dish...oh I remember! It was corn on the cob, over cooked and obviously sitting in a pot all day as it lacked any flavor.

I contacted HP support and was on hold for an *** hour *** before someone finally told me they couldn't provide me with a cable that would work. Even if they had one to send me, they wouldn't send one out.
This is the only monitor I've seen that has the audio-in and VGA attach perpendicular to the plane of the monitor, and that's the whole problem. All other monitors that I've seen have the power, VGA, DVI, and audio, connections so that the cables run parallel to the plane of the monitor. It's common sense from a design perspective.
A low profile audio cable can probably solve this design flaw, but HP was not willing to help.

A19JGPUJAX048H,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"Rachel Porter is a special agent for the US government.  Big deal, you say.  Been there, done that.  However, Rachel is a special agent for the US Fish & Wildlife Service - not one of the typical literary government crime-busting agencies.  This allows the author to approach the crime from a completely different direction, which was a nice change of pace.
The characters were interesting.  Rachel is a person who is used to running from her problems, and here she's forced to make a choice and decide whether or not to take a stand.  Her boss, who initially seemed like a stereotypical boss from hell, has depth to his character.  The detective in charge of the investigation is not one of the usual stalwart heroes - there are a lot of dark shadings to his character.  The secondary characters all have their own charm.
The story takes place in New Orleans and its surrounding swamplands.  Rachel is called in when a dead alligator is found at the scene of a murder - a hooker has beeen ritualistically slashed to death.  The story begins with that and then takes off into political corruption, murder, drug running, neo-Nazis, and the Mob.  The descriptions of the people, politics and places are vivid and realistic.

Thought the $37 fee was a decent low price for a public course - little did I know it would be the worst $37 I've ever spent.  I've been playing golf for over 20 years - playing mostly public courses around the Philadelphia area, and never in my life have I seen such a run down crappy course.  There wasn't a single hole with grass on the fairway, I mean that literally.  We were playing ""plug and place"" rules usually only deemed necessary when there's been a serious rainstorm and the ball plugs in the fairway.  We instead played if you hit the fairway, you can pick the ball up and move it to the nearest grass area within 50 ft (50ft!!) and even with that rule, I still threw my ball into the rough most of the time because that was the only grass I could find.  I can't believe Springfield is charging people to play this course, I'd rather have just played in the parking lot.  No drinking water anywhere on the course, and the the final kicker, was that the ranger was more concerned about my driving the cart off the path than he was keeping pace of play - when we got to the 14th tee box - there were 4 groups on waiting to tee off!!!

I have been to many race tracks both in the USA & Canada.  I have never even seen one
without trees or ponds or some type of landscaping in the infield.
Harrahs decorates the infield with MUD. The track itself, just as bad.
It's like racing on a dirt road. I don't know if the driver was injured today
but he would not be the first.  This racetrack was 'shut down' for a period a few years ago, but I guess it meant nothing to the 'brass'

p5NiZtwC0krZsXvvy21w5g,Yelp,"Yum! I was on Jefferson's campus looking for a bite to eat with a friend and we agreed on Thai - this place was a great choice!

I ordered the Tom Yum soup and the fried dumplings and my friend got the Penang Curry. The Tom Yum soup was incredible, flavor wise. The one thing I did not enjoy about it was the shrimp in the soup was not de-tailed so it was kind of awkward digging into my soup and getting it out and having to do this. I ended up just not eating the shrimp because of how messy it was and also it kinda tasted like frozen shrimp tossed into my hot soup (not fresh). Otherwise, though, the soup was excellent...Maybe they should just nix the shrimp as an ingredient? The dumplings at first tasted good but once they cooled down a bit were just fried dough with random, somewhat flavorless stuffing so I only ended up eating about half of them.

The Penang curry, however, redeemed the dumplings! I normally do not like coconut or coconut flavored things. This, however, was delicious!!! It was served with your typical white rice in a pot and was so perfect. Must. try. It has slightly redeemed coconut for me and I find myself wishing I had ordered the same thing.

The service was prompt and the waiter was friendly and attentive (as much as he could be - he was often slightly delayed due to a very big party next to us but that clearly wasn't his fault). When we wrapped up, he gave us 10% discount for being Jefferson students just because he saw our IDs - we did not know about the discount and hadn't asked for it and I thought this was awesome so he gets five stars (wish I would've caught his name...next time). He also was very helpful with the spice level. He suggested a lower spice level (3) then what we were going for (4) and turned out to be right, but brought out hot sauce for us just incase he was wrong and we wanted more spice (we didn't). 

The inside is a lot nicer than what we expected with soft lighting and modern seating. It's not what you expect based on the sign/outside. There are two full screen TVs above the bar and a whole back dining area. 

All in all, this place seems to have some fabulous but also some sub par menu items so if you feel like having some Thai food in the area, I would definitely give it a shot.",1,delicious!!!,delicious!+,delicious!,"This, however, was delicious!!!",The inside is a lot nicer than what we expected with soft lighting and modern seating.,"['This,' 'however,' 'was' 'delicious!!!']",[1 1 1 5]

A381C6UUUIAB4V,Amazon_Reviews/Electronics,"I backed up a Norton backup from my secondary 1TB internal hard drive onto an external Seagate GoFlex 3TB hard drive. It took 11 hours and 38 minutes. That is a loooonnnngggg time. My backup HDD was almost full and that was with only two backup file/folders, so I decided to store the older file that I had started in 2011, that included pictures and music and took up a lot of memory. I recently decided to start a new backup; September 2015, which sucked up about 250GB, but archived the older 735GB folder.

I have an older EVGA X58 SLI x3 motherboard that I bought in April 2009. It has the Intel i7 920 Nehalem 2.66GHz quad processor with 12 GB DDR3 1600 mamory. My backup HDD is a WD 1TB, but it is not the black. I must have just missed the newer X58 motherboard (MB) that came with USB 3.0 and only so I only have USB 2.0. No, I never got around to doing any over-clocking with this MB or adding more graphics cards to the SLI 2 or 3 slots. I don't do any gaming to speak of or any graphic arts that require that kind of fun.

I decided it was time to upgrade my USB as I don't have the necessity to build a new computer, so I got this USB 3.0 card and installed it in the available secondary  x16/x8 PCI Express 2 slot. I thought about trying it in the third x8 slot, but I read it needed to be in the x16, if not in the x1 slot, and I had other chores to perform. Unfortunately, this motherboard only has one PCI express x1 slot and it is covered by my GTX 285 video card.
Anyway, I used the 4 pin to SATA power adapter cable, loaded the drivers from the CD and everything worked great.

While I had hoped for a bit more speed, with the USB 3,  the transfer to the Seagate went from 11+ hours to 4 hours and 15 minutes for the same file, which I deleted afterwards; only need 1. Anyway, I'll take the 2.5x faster speed.

The hotel was two blocks away from the park where the fireworks were displayed which made for easy walking and no mess of driving out during the big rush! Location of the hotel is the best feature. Especially nice was the cost of the hotel compared to other hotels that were similar distances from the fireworks display - this hotel was about 60% of the cost of the other hotels, plus free parking and a full kitchen. Those perks were great, but the comfort of the bed was my one big complaint. I did not sleep well. The bed was harder than I've seen at even the cheapest hotels.

We decided to start with the charbroiled oysters and ordered a few of their wines our server suggested. The oysters looked good but they were cold and lacked flavor. We waited awhile for these to come out considering they were ordered as an appetizer. Initially I was very upset and didn't understand what my family and fellow yelpers had been raved about. Our server brought over a member of the the management staff after seeing how disappointed we were with the drinks and oysters. Miss Jaqueline assured us she would handle everything and we waited no more than 5 minutes for freshly made oysters and differing wine samples so we could find something we actually enjoyed. She truly listened to our concerns . Let me tell you the second time around it was as if we entered a new restaurant oysters were cooked to perfection and full of flavor.

However the case itself protected the camera and it is no worse for ware, see the picture.

A153F3QOGIUSRD,Amazon_Reviews/Electronics,"I admit it....I'm economically conservative and it annoys me to pay more than necessary for stuff to get the quality and performance that I want.  Occasionally however, you encounter an item or service that fills the bill so nicely, you really don't mind the upgraded pricing as long as you get the quality that satisfies the perfectionist in your psyche.  Like a $50 steak that surprises and satisfies you such that you stop grumbling about the bucks and start bragging about the delicious meal and the great service.  Hence, the SELP18-105 G OSS.  I hesitated, I gagged and I grumbled about the price......until I put it on my Nex 7 and took a spin around our local duck pond with it's multi-colored citizens, lush green backgrounds and splashing fountains.  BINGO!  Yep its that good.  In spite of the reviews that niggle about the pin-cushion effect if you use it without the jpeg correction tools that are inherent to many of the Sony alphas and nexs.  Colorful, contrasty, and sharp as a tack.  That's my story and I'm stick'in to it.  My Mrs and I just completed an 8 day coach tour of the Fall colors in 8 states of New England and WOW.  It rained 5 of the 7 days.  But my trusty Nex 7 coupled with the 18-105G just kept on truck'n.  Kept tucking the equipment under my rain coat or jacket to protect it from the rain drop, and it just kept on performing beautfully.  Now let me concentrate on the lens a little more.  I don't interpret lens performance in terms of pixels and 100% crops.  I simply calls it as I sees it....and hears it.  This G is as smooth as butter and as solid as a tank.  The jpeg engine so completely takes care of any distortion or pin cushioning - even before you take the shot - you never see it.  What you do see is a beautiful rendered scene that is colorful, beautifully contrasted from the shadows to the bright spots, and as sharp as you might like.  Our tour mates continually commented on my photos and wanted to know just how I took such great photo's in such poor rainy-day lighting.  I just gave all the credit the G lens.  I took over 780 photos on the trip and expect for the ones taken through the wet and rainy coach windows, lots of winners made it to my album.
Thanks, Sony.  You've made a winner with this one.  A great value even at almost $600 per copy!",1,price......,price...+,price...,"I hesitated, I gagged and I grumbled about the price......","Hence, the SELP18-105 G OSS.","['I' 'hesitated,' 'I' 'gagged' 'and' 'I' 'grumbled' 'about' 'the'

A3DQDBDRU1FWKK,Amazon_Reviews/Electronics,"Review:
Card performed very nice to begin with and game my build a ROG theme that didn't break the bank. Then after about a month I started getting restarts out of the blue after being on for about an hour or so. I lost some work, but nothing to bad. Thought it was a fluke but kept it happening and I kept getting BCCODE 116 every time with no solutions.

Solutions tried:
Tried new rolling back from most recent driver, clean installed the most recent driver then Downloaded BlueScreenView and was able to get a better read on the issues causing the restart. Searched those issues but kept coming up with the same fixes but none worked. Finally popped in my old 8600gt card (I kept as a back up for emergency purposes because it's freaking loud!) and the computer has been running hours with no problems. So I determined it was the card. Bummed. Glad it wasn't my motherboard (that was one of the potential problems), even though this card costs more than my mother board.

Conclusion:
Luckily I was 2 days from my return deadline through Amazon..THANK GOD!!!! I heard dealing with ASUS RMA is a nightmare. Amazon was awesome. Chatted and solved my issue. They sent me packing label and issued a refund. Now I wish they could just find me a card as I am hesitant in buying another STRIKER.",0,GOD!!!!,GOD!+,GOD!,THANK GOD!!!!,Chatted and solved my issue.,['THANK' 'GOD!!!!'],[5 5]

Granola, coconut, hemp seeds, peanut butter, Nutella, blueberries, strawberries, bananas, honey and many others. So yummy!!!! They have other bowls as well that I'd like to come back and try soon like dragon fruit and kale. This original, quaint little establishment is great for breakfast, lunch or simply a filling mid day meal those days you worked through lunch but realize its starting to get too close to dinner time.

Wouldnt be stunned if it was labeled an addictive drug... its that damn good , if thet were to go brick oven, they could upset the balance of roxpizza hood  

SO far I have yet to have anything that wasnt friggin DELICIOUS from there.  

Price is comparable to any pizza shop ...Spend $30.00 you get a free 2 liter with your order and you can even order on line 

And they dont skimp on portion sizes either 

Now you know it isnt all wine and roses right? ... the dirt, they seem to screw up orders pretty often.   Id say at least 4 times, weve gotten somthing we didnt order, and its not like the driver just grabbed the wrong stuff... they always say..(well make that up for you ) meaning it wasnt made..but what the hell $hit happens! ..and theyre always cool about it

A1EDW2MY52QRJJ,Amazon_Reviews/Books,"This book is everything. I mean EVERYTHING! I encourage anyone and everyone to read. I stayed up all night to finish it, now I must take a quick nap and get on to reading the second book.

I'm emotionally wrecked!!! But in such a good way. It's heartbreaking and heartwarming. It's dark and it's light. It's smart, witty, loving, serious, funny, soulful, and so much more... and that's just the book in general. The characters...!!!!!!!

Hayden is perfect, just perfect. I've always seen reviews where people talk about 'book boyfriends' and I've never really been into that whole notion. BUT let me tell you if I ever claimed a book boyfriend, it would 100 percent be Hayden. He's so much more than the tatted up deviant that you see in the very beginning. He's deep, full of soul and love. And I just love him! Absolutely can't wait to read the second book so we get more of HIS story. 

Tenley... all I can say is WOAH. Without giving away spoilers, that girl has been through SOOO fxcking much and still continues on her journey. I mean there's no way I could go on like she has done. She's so brave and strong and doesn't even realize it.. which is why I'm reading that second book immediately! I can't wait to read how she continues her journey and becomes an even stronger person.

Their love is inspiring and I haven't even read their whole story!! I think the best thing is how Tenley continues to say she's sooo dependent on him but honestly they both can and have stood on their own for a long time. They are independent, they are each their own person BUT so much better together which I LOVE.

This book will open up your mind to a different perspective in the looming future of an all things digital world. For those who did not go through the 1st industrial revolution, this will also be a vivid walkthrough of the first one. It is well written to impact you, to give you a mental picture what it is like during the 1st industrial revolution. This book will also endow you with an insight for what is happening in the second one and what is to be of coming. A good argument of the income spread which is enough to discredit a good deal of thesis done on income spread based on traditional thinking. This will not only impact your mindset, but it will also bring forth why some business leaders are investing heavily on certain businesses. Business leaders who had been through the 1st industrial revolution know how it is like during the exciting exponential growth of ideas and quality of life.
